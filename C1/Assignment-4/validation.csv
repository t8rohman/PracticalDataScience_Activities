__label__0 "i did n't realize it had a tie around the waist . it seems too much material hanging in the front to tie at the waist . unfortunately the sash is attached and can not be removed . it 's very cute ; just not for me . i will have to return ( but sure i can find something else ) !"
__label__1 "this flew out of my local store so fast i had to order on line . simply stunning . was reluctant to pay high price but worth it . will get much wear ."
__label__1 "best part : covers my bum . perfect for teaching casual girls ' night or casual date night . my only complaint is there are n't other colors . awful decision . i would have purchased at least 5 of these at the right price ."
__label__-1 "the fabric and colors of this dress are beautiful but the fit is terrible . i had to go up a size to get a fit in the waist but it was then incredibly loose in the shoulders . what a pity . had to return ."
__label__1 "very cute and flattering . very fitting in legs and thighs and i have fairly slim legs . i am a size 6 and 6 was very snug . i recommend trying these on in store or trying several sizes to see best fit ."
__label__0 "was so excited for this top ! loved the embroidered detail and the teal green color . i got it in a medium and it was swimming on me . it also had a maternity type feel since there is a lot more material ( making it look blousy ) than showing on the model ( they must have pinned it back in the stock photo ) . sadly it 's going back ."
__label__0 "this dress could have been great but for me there was too much design on the top part/ front . i wish the neckline was different or just less beadwork/ design near my face . all in all its a maxi dress and was returned because approx . $ 250 was too much to spend on this ."
__label__0 "this dress is such a beautiful color and the fabric is super soft and lovely . it would be stunning on someone with a slim figure but since i 've got curves/an athletic build it simply did not work . too bad because it is such a pretty dress !"
__label__-1 "i wish i had read all the reviews before purchasing . the sweater looked liked everything i would be interested in online . once i pulled it out of the bag my first thought was how could retailer send me a used washed and shrunken sweater . it is nothing like the picture . it fits like a midriff top not exaggerating . i 'm 5.6 ordered the m do n't waste your shipping money on this ."
__label__1 "love this coat - great fall piece ! i bought the green color and it looks as shown in the picture . great retailer purchase !"
__label__1 "i love this . it is perfect . it is sheer but i wear a black cami underneath and it looks great . so glad antro finally has something with a waist ! the small metal buttons are a really nice added detail . i wish you would make more tops with a defined waist like this one !"
__label__0 "just a heads up - this is a romper - pants and not a dress ! you ca n't tell from the pictures . i ordered thinking it was a dress but it 's actually ... culottes ? i 'm not sure what you would call it . the pull on styling was awkward and the sash was bulky . it definitely goes back !"
__label__1 "this is a great light free flowing top for the summer . i agree with the other reviewers that the top section hits in a weird area but if you are small busted you wo n't be affected . it can be dressed up or down with jewelry and offers a whimsical option to a plain white blouse for the summer !"
__label__1 "loved this dress . fit like a glove so flattering and perfect for a summer/fall wedding . material is substantial and dress is well made . i 'm 5 ' 4 large chest and curvy and a size 6 fit perfectly . longer than seen on the model for me but i actually love it being tea-length . a strip of tulle attached to the lining underneath the skirt to help it poof . i removed it but looks good either way ."
__label__1 "love this tank . it is so soft and comfortable . the length hits just right on the hip . it hugs the body nicely not too tight just loose enough on a hot summer day . i have this in black and white . i wish they would offer more colors ."
__label__0 "so the dress is interesting . has an asymmetrical wrap look short sexy length ( i 'm 5 ' 3 and the petite barely covers my assets ) and a neckline that implies sexy without actually displaying the girls- it crosses over and stays closed but looks sexy and plunging . but the shoulders are what make it look matronly . they 're wide- from neck out to the outer edge of my shoulder/upper arm . they show no shoulder at all which is really an odd design when the rest of the dress is sexy-ish . i looked back"
__label__0 "i ordered this item when it was first advertised fell in love with the unique pattern in the top and could hardly wait for it to get here . however when i received the top i was very disappointed the fabric is cheap the sleeves are tight and the overall product is of poor quality and poorly constructed . needless to say i returned it ."
__label__1 "these leggings are so comfortable and luxurious . when i opened the package i knew i was in trouble . they are comfortable and beautiful . a perfect piece for any wardrobe ."
__label__-1 "this dress ran large -- maybe because the pleats made this dress too roomy . the dress hung on my right shoulder but the dress did not hold up at all on the left side of my body maybe because i have a short torso/petite frame . i loved the yellow color for summer -- it would have made for a nice dress to wear for a wedding . unfortunately i had to return it ."
__label__0 "i wanted this top to fit . i ordered a large and was swimming in it . i returned it to the store where they had it in all sizes . i tried on a medium and it was still too big and then a small that fit but i just did not love it . i did not have trouble with it being cut too low . i think it might look best on someone who is straight up and down and not hourglass since it blouses over the waist . this print is soooo pretty ! !"
__label__1 "i just received this shirt in the mail and i 'm in love . it is n't your average t-shirt in that it has character and class . i ca n't wait to wear it ! another reviewer was unhappy that the embroidery in blue on the back was n't as dramatic as the picture ; i 'm not seeing it . i think the blue stands out very well . i know i should say hurry and get yours before they 're gone but in truth i 'd rather be the only one with this beautiful shirt ! : )"
__label__1 "this garment is beautiful because the fabric has great drape to it . i am probably between a small and xsmall but ordered the xsmall . it is snug but i have decided to keep it and can wear a cami underneath just in case the buttons gap just a little . i am concerned that going up a size with leave the neck area too gaping . it is also a little snug in the elbow area ."
__label__0 "it did n't work with my frame at all but is very nice !"
__label__0 "frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top . i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out . but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy . and it has an attached camisole but the sheerness of the top still showed my nude-colored bra strap . so i do n't even know what to wear under it . it 's going back even with the sale price ."
__label__0 "i ordered this top in red based on one of the reviews . it is more like marroon . i am very disappointed . the top itself is plain cotton and not that great quality . it is long and has the belt at the back but the fit and quality overall are very plain . it looks a tad dowdy . i am still keeping it because i got it on sale and i can wear it at home with lounge leggings . but it is definitely not dressy . perhaps white may not look as bad . the plain design and marroon dull color do n't help ."
__label__-1 "i did n't think top was very flattering and while in the picture the mismatched hem lines in the collar looked cute in person it just looks odd . this is especially true of the back of the sort where the mismatched hem repeats at the bottom ... just looks mis-sewn instead of purposeful . sadly this one is going back to the store ."
__label__0 "really liked this dress but it ran too big for me ."
__label__-1 "i had this in my cart for a week before i took the plunge because i thought it would make the cutest boho statement piece that could go from beach to casual evening outings . i 'm 5 ' 9 so i got the m/l to ensure length . maybe that was wrong ? if the laid flat width was included maybe that would have been more helpful but this thing was massive and looked like a potato sack . the side slits ( of course hidden in the photos ) came up to just over my natural waist enhancing that effect . i loved the"
__label__1 "this top is very comfortable and really cute on . the material is super soft . i bought the white and am very happy with it but it is a little sheer so i have to wear a cami with it . i would definitely recommend !"
__label__0 "this is such a cute top with so much potential soft fabric vibrant colors and flattering fit on top . however like so many of retailer swing tops lately it has tons of fabric at the bottom making it billow in a very unflattering way . i ordered it in an xxsp so i ca n't even go down in size so this top regrettably has to go back . i love swing tops but retailer could we please have tops that do not double for maternity tops ? ?"
__label__-1 "the concept of this top is cool and the outer fabric is nice . the inner layer is sheer but as long as you 're wearing a nude-colored bra no big deal . however i did find the inner layer to be scratchy . they must 've photoshopped the fit of the top on the model or altered the top because it looks like it hangs straight on her . i ordered an xs and when you pull it out of the package it clearly flares out & is a-line . so as a previous reviewer stated it looks huge from the front . if it had fit the"
__label__0 "i am a petite size 10 and 5 & # 39 ; 1 & quot ; i love the fabric and style of the dress but found it to be too much dress for me . the skirt is very full and with the top i feel it would look better on a thin taller person ."
__label__1 "cute top but does stretch out a bit throughout the day ."
__label__0 "i 'm surprised this worked for so many people . for me this dress fit terribly . however the fabric was very thick and the dress felt very well made . i am 5 ' 3 and about 117 with a really short torso and this dress just showed every bump and lump i have . i think the bodice was just too long for me . the neckline was also too low . on someone taller or maybe with a longer torso i could see this dress being really lovely ."
__label__1 "this skirt is so cute ! ! highly recommend super easy to dress up or to dress down . it is n't shown as well in the picture but it has really intricate and pretty detailed stitching throughout the skirt . i have gotten so many compliments on it random people have even stopped to tell me how much they like it and where they can find it . it runs a little small so i recommend buying it a size up . also if you 're taller like me it is a little short in the back . overall a great buy !"
__label__1 "i love love love the fit in the corduroy so thought about grabbing these jeans as well . they fit much pretty well just the color was n't quite right . i 'm really picky about the blueness of my jeans and these do n't quite match the coloring in the photo . still debating whether to keep them . love the cuff styling and straight leg fit !"

__label__-1 "i purchased this in the yellow for my daughter and she has not seen it yet . the style is very cute but the fabric is quite thin . she will have to make that call but if i had bought it for myself it would be going back . i 'm not willing to wear a camisole under a t-shirt . it also feels like the kind of knit fabric that shrinks and skews when it 's washed so that remains to be seen ."
__label__-1 "such a great dress . fit is flattering . the small v cut in the front and beading around the neckline keep it from becoming a boring lbd . classy enough to wear to a funeral but can be dressed up with some killer shoes . thrilled with purchase !"
__label__1 "i would have bought this had it not been for the way the pockets are sewn in . they are attached on the inside by a string . if the string broke the pockets would dangle . for the price you would think they would have sewn pockets in to the vest . too bad ."
__label__0 "i wanted a casual but special summer dress and had high hopes for this one . i normally like to try things on as it is difficult to tell fit online . when it arrived i was disappointed with this dress . it is very full in the skirt the top fit a bit odd not a lot of shape and not especially flattering . the fabric was n't very exciting either . unfortunately this one went back ."
__label__0 "the quality and color is great on this top . the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true off-the -shoulder look . and to wear it as a cowl neck ( or actually looks like a boat neck ) just makes it too ordinary- since i love the off the shoulder look . it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering- so i think my size was right . the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other ."
__label__0 "i got this shirt and loved it so much the first time i wore it . it swings well and is an easy basic that looks great . however after i washed it the first time it became clingy and stuck to me and does n't lie right . it 's such a shame because i was thrilled with this as an addition to my wardrobe !"
__label__1 "i love the cold shoulder trend ! this sweater is not bulky but the thick knit will keep you warm while looking stylish ! it is not your typical sweater . if you want something unique but still basic this is your sweater . looks great with jeans and khakis ."
__label__1 "beautiful sweater ! ! i love the color and the fit . the cowl neck is n't too tight and the sweater hangs away from the body without being boxy . it comes down to the low hip on me . very soft and cozy . i purchased the aqua in xs . fits perfectly and i 'm 5 5 ' 127lbs ."
__label__0 "the front and back of this square sweater are the same and the pattern of the stitching makes it look like it 's on backwards.the lace would be nice but it 's itchy . and the sweater is cropped so i think the layered lace look is odd because the whole thing is so short on the body . the 3/4 sleeves make it look small and fitted but the body shape is bulky . just could n't get it to work ."

__label__0 "cute but too thick and rough"
__label__0 "definitely was disappointed in the fit of this potentially very cute shirt . just too large ; too much fabric for me . i 'm usually an xs and there was just no shape to that size for my small bod . i would n't have minded the longer length if there had been a better fit up top . i think the colors are also a bit duller in person . love the concept though !"

__label__1 "i love this slip .. i am contemplating whether i can pass it off as a dress over the summer . the skirt is a subtle shinier grey than the top . it is flattering with or without a bra and i am not usually the type to go without . i am 5 ' 3 32c and the xs fits perfectly ! also i think it looks better in person ."
__label__1 "the print and fit of this dress is perfect ! it 's very flattering and slimming ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this top ! on me it was weirdly boxy . it was too wide and too short and it was more sheer than i expected it . the fabric is lightweight but wrinkles really easy and loses shape pretty quickly . i also thought the fabric would be heavier and have more structure than it has . i love the scalloped detail at the arms but after about five minutes of wear this felt super crumpled and just kind of sloppy . unfortunately it will be going back ."
__label__-1 "i tried this on in the store and was disappointed because it looked so fresh and vibrant on the hanger . but it 's basically cut for model-sized people only . it 's short and wide and if you have any boobs at all it 'll make the back pucker . i ca n't imagine this will look good on most women ."
__label__1 "this was another unusual choice for a larger busted woman like myself but i could n't say no to that sweet little back detail . i 'll attack the waist with a cropped jacket . for those looking to add volume or flowy fabric you 've found your answer and then some !"
__label__0 "this would be great on someone with a slim build . it 's very true to size it hits above the hips and runs pretty straight through the body for a boxy look . i loved the color and pointelle detail but on my thicker build it just sort of hung in a too-casual way . note that it is the kind of cotton that is likely to stretch with wear ( and spring back with cleaning ) ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress but sadly i will be returning . the color looked fairly different in person than on the model . i thought it was a browner/neutral hue but the dress is almost like a yellow seersucker-ish with brownish moth printing . was cuter than expected ! the sweetheart neckline is darling but that is where it fit me poorly . i have a 34c bust and the cups of the size 4 were gaping on me in the front and all along the arm holes . the straps were also way too long and falling off my"

__label__0 "very pretty dress . the color is much brighter in person - a little too bubblegum pink for me . i love the way the bodice fit but there was just too much material in the skirt which made me look hippier than i am . would have preferred the skirt to have more of an a-line cut"

__label__0 "in my opinion for this amount of money the dress needs to be something really different . and this one is n't . it has several structural issues and it seems to have a split personality ( summery material dark color flirty and fun ... but overly conservative up top . ) initially the top portion is extremely sheer . you 're saved ( a bit ) by the extra fabric at the front but it still seemed odd that the top is n't lined - particularly for a dress meant for winter . there 's too much going on up top . th"

__label__0 "i tried this dress on in the store prepared to buy this lovely piece . i feel that it should have been a few inches longer it would look more proportionate . next the tie is really difficult to place but it creates some great detail to the front and back . it wrinkles easily i can see it would need to be ironed before each wear . lastly it is not lined what a bummer at least the skirt could be lined . but it does have pockets that is sweet ."
__label__-1 "these shorts just did n't work for me . i loved the embroidery and the color but i just do n't have the curves for them . try these if you have an hourglass or fuller figure ."
__label__0 "love the idea of this but it ran short and boxier than i would have liked . material is soft cute design but not flattering . returning"
__label__1 "this jacket is so well made and absolutely beautiful . i usually wear a size 4 or small in everything at retailer . sadly i ordered a small and will have to return it too tight on chest and arms . i recommend going a size up . also this jacket is really cropped probably needs a hifh waist pant to compliment it otherwise might appear too short ."
__label__0 "this dress is so cute and so flattering . i loved the shape but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything ! just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric ! when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better .."
__label__0 "nice quality and feel to the fabric but they are super lightweight and do not come down to the ankle . they fall at a strange place on the calf - a better cropped summer pant perhaps ."
__label__0 "loved the idea of this top -- but it just wo n't work for me . it 's really big . i 'm 5 ' 3 and 125 lbs . a small should be fine but i 'm swimming in this . the back is pretty ( i tried it on with a white cami ) but it looks very maternity on me . tried to order the xs but it 's sold out . too bad . was a cute idea . not too thin for summer ."
__label__1 "the material is great ! ! got them in both colors and went with a tall size for one . everyone compliments them !"
__label__1 "i agree with others that the shape is not perfect it does billow a bit by the hips . but the xxs petite ( someone returned ) was good on me . length was perfect sleeve were not too tights . ( 30dd 26.5 in waist 35 in hips 115 lbs ) colors are subdued making the jacket more neutral . keeping in mind for later ..."
__label__-1 "these pants are the perfect color and i love the detail of the zippered pockets ... i was so excited when they came in the mail and fit pretty well . they were slightly loose but i thought they would hold their shape and the size smaller would be too small . after an hour of wear i was swimming in these ! i can almost pull them down without unzipping them and the seat of the pants looks particularly um saggy . i am in-between a 4 and 6 and since the pants are detailed as slim fit i thought it"
__label__-1 "i love everything by cloth & stone so was excited to see that they made a dress . hooray ! i ordered it in the xl which is my usual size in their shirts . when i tried it on i was so sad to see that it barely fit around my tummy and hips ! i am a true size 12/14 and the xl just barely gave me enough room to move . my chest also caused the dreaded button gape . it is clear that they cut the dress for people with a stick straight figure . so disappointing ! !"
__label__-1 "the sweater could be really pretty but it is huge . i ordered the xs/s and it was swimming on me . it 's too bad because the stitching was beautiful but this item is going back ."
__label__-1 "this top is exactly what i was hoping for except it is missing the drawstring . so disappointing mailing it back ."
__label__1 "i got this top in the beige size small . it is flattering and though i had n't noticed the lace details in the back before i purchased it they are a nice touch . this is a versatile piece . i can dress it up or down . this will definitely be a favorite of mine this season ."
__label__0 "i ordered this in the blue it 's a beautiful shade of blue . love the lace up detail in the back but the size small was just short and very wide . i understand it is a swing top but this was not flattering on me . i 'm short waisted 34-d 5 ' 3 125 lbs . i 'm sure it would be cute on a very thin person ."
__label__1 "these pants are great . the pattern is beautiful and the fit is perfect . they pair well with a s front tucked shirt or fitted colwyn neck sweater . another great find from retailer !"
__label__0 "absolutely stinning dress ! statement piece for sure however i will agree with other reviews that the bust is small and has no give or wiggle room with the side zipper ... one if those dreaded side zippers that you always fear breaking as you dress . sizing up would help but the waist then appears too big or bulky .. i am on the fence about whether or not it 's a keeper ... definitely perfect for the smaller chested . i usually wear xs size 2/4 the 6 zipped the 4 nearly did but would 've smashed . neverth"
__label__0 "really wanted to love dress but something was off with fit . fabric is lovely and zipper detail nice unfortunately style was not for me ."
__label__1 "i thought this was much more of an overall than a jumpsuit . after trying it on in a store ( must have been a return ) i could tell that the medium was snug and usually i am between a medium or a small . the straps were a little hard to manage . it is cute and i think cuter than on the model ."
__label__-1 "got this in the sky color . returned it because the top is way too sheer for me if you know what i mean . i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids . no can do . also for the price material just felt flimsy & cheap . it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i 'm 5 ' 2 114 # 34b"
__label__0 "this shirt is beautiful and so soft . it would have made a wonderful long-sleeved tee except for the fact that it was so low cut . the only way this is wearable is with a tank underneath which for me defeats the purpose of this type of shirt . i am rather busty ( 34 dd ) so maybe if you are smaller on top you might could pull it off ."
__label__1 "this skirt fits amazing . i run between a s and m in bottoms and went with the s. there is a little give in the fabric which is always a plus . this will surely become a staple in my wardrobe ."
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this dress . the striped material was very nice and would go with so much plus the length was great . however the buttons were a nightmare . the buttons are barely in the button holes and give very easily . the linen material is going to give even more with wear and the button holes are sure to loosen up even more . as i was trying the dress on and moving around two different buttons gave way on me . maybe the very slender will be able to wear this without buttons sliding out"
__label__0 "this dress is very cute and fits quite well . you do n't have to wear a bra with it which is awesome and it has delightful pockets . the downside is that the fabric on the top half is a little weird . it is very heavy and stiff . also the inside has some fraying and the quality does not seem to be the best . i 'm keeping it though ."
__label__0 "i loved this but could n't believe how small it was ."
__label__0 "i loved the color of these but they bagged out with just one wear . they are going back to store ."
__label__0 "this top did not look at all like it did on the model . i thought it would be slightly loose through the hips but instead it was snug on top and very very very loose . great for someone who is pregnant . which i am not . returning ."
__label__0 "fabric was a little more shear than i thought it would be - while not a big deal - it was missing a few of the silver beads along the front line of the top . returned"
__label__1 "although it kind of ran big and the material is stiff causing some protrusion off my shoulders i decided to keep it only because it was unique and still looked cute"
__label__0 "i ordered the blue stripe and white in size large . i did n't like it worn off shoulder but it does stay in place which is a good thing . and it looks okay worn on the shoulders . i find the fabric so uncomfortable and itchy that i could n't wait to take it off immediately . i tried them on again a second time still hopeful with the same outcome . sadly returning ."
__label__-1 "i agree with the other reviewers that this runs big . unfortunately there is nothing smaller than an xs so this is going back . i love the lyocell material i have another skirt with this material and wanted to love this as well but it is too big and with the drawstring pulled tight to fit it does n't look right . it is not as pictured as well . the skirt i received is a medium blue denim not the lovely light blue as pictured another reason why i am returning ."
__label__-1 "i was very disappointed when it arrived and had elbow length sleeves . from the photo it looked like full length sleeves . it went back ."
__label__0 "i did n't have as much of a problem with the sheer fabric as the other reviewers but this dress is incredibly long and large especially compared to the picture . for reference i 'm usually a 4/6 in retailer dresses and the small was huge on me particularly on the bottom half . i was very disappointed because this dress looks so cute online !"
__label__-1 "i read the other review that said the shirt was boxy i did n't think it would be a terribly big deal . unfortunately it is . normally i wear a size s so i sized down o an xs . the shirt fits in the sleeves and neckline but the shirt is still very box and now super short . unfortunately this is going back . not a good fit . adorable details but the fit is terrible ."
__label__0 "i had different expectations for this shirt in blue and when i received the item it did n't met those expectations . the material is very good quality but there is nothing extraordinary about the shirt it is jus very plain . this item is being returned ."
__label__-1 "the jeans look so different online ! the pair i got did not have the stone washed look and was completely different cut . the rise is not as stated and is actually 10.5 inches ! also i 'm a true 25 and the waist is like a 27 but the legs are super skinny . i 'm so disappointed and i 'm not even sure if is worth swapping out for a smaller size . these look more like men 's cut jeans ."
__label__0 "when i received this dress today i was really excited to try it on . it is a pretty dress . looked good in the pictures . however when i examined it and proceeded to try it on i was really disappointed . the quality is ok but not expected for the price paid . and the cut is off . it is extremely small at the top . i am not big by any means ( 32d 109lbs 5 ' 0 ) . the bottom part fit . sadly not impressed . this one is going back : ("
__label__0 "i coveted this item since i first saw it on instagram . i finally bought it in coral . it 's a beautiful coat the color is lovely and i like the way the hood makes a cute collar when worn down . the only problem is it looks like a bathrobe on me . i am 5 ' 5 and wear a size 8. i bought a medium worried a small would not button . the sleeves are far too long . i do not want to go through the trouble of returning so gave it to my daughter who is four inches taller . it looks cute in her ."
__label__0 "top is very wide and flowy . i am petite with large chest so it hung from widest point and was not flattering . would be very cute with the right body shape ."
__label__-1 "wanted to love this colorful romper . the fabric was suuuuper thin and very cheap feeling and looking . no way would i wear this ."
__label__-1 "i was excited to see this top ordered it and was disappointed . it was too tight across the chest and had too much fabric around the bottom . i tried this on 3 times hoping for i had been wrong in previous assessments- no luck ."
__label__-1 "this is a beautiful dress but the fit was strange . i have a small waist and larger hips . i generally wear a 0-2 in a fit & flare style but styles like this i generally wear a 2-4 for my hips . even in a 4 this was catching on my hips and looked kind of dumpy on my top half . i really think this dress would be great on a frame that had wider shoulders and smaller hips . it really is pretty ."
__label__-1 "bummed out .. this is super cheaply made and very expensive ... the design is different the color is beautiful but the material is a different story .. it should be priced at the most 30 bucks .. not 128 .. i 'm returning them . also they run very big .. !"
__label__-1 "sadly this has to go back . i am 5 ' 5 128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me . very short . and it 's so wide it 's almost a trapeze cut . the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt . which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful the detail is nice in person even the sleeve cuffs are great . i am not very tall and i 'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles loose and tight . the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love these they are cute and warm - but they have absolutely no elasticity . i 'm so mad at myself for not reading the reviews because i ended up wasting money on shipping 2 pairs of leggings that i ultimately took right back to the store ."
__label__1 "i did n't think much of this online but it was very nice in person . i was nervous it would look bulky but it was very flattering and slimming . fits tts ."
__label__-1 "the color of this dress is gorgeous and i really wanted to love it . but it was awful . i am 5 ' 9 `` and the length was fine . the problem is the lack of shape which made me look 50 - 100 lbs heavier than i am . it would make a great maternity dress since that is what it already looks like ."
__label__-1 "well i wanted to love it and it was just too much . i think it is a bit wider and weirdly baggier than it should be . i also feel it should be fully lined . it was not . the exterior wool and pattern is very nice . maybe if it was lined a smaller size would have worked better but for the price i needed more . i also would have liked some sort of option for tightening the waist a bit when zipped up . i realize this is n't in the picture so no expectation but upon trying it on and seeing its boxines"
__label__1 "these pants are perfect for crisp fall weather and comfortable ! i wear them with flats to dress down or heels to dress up ! recommended for all shapes !"
__label__1 "this is my third dress-the first one was the right size but the plaid fell on the dress in an awkward way . the second one was a size too small but this one is perfect ! i am wearing it with a belt and loving it !"
__label__0 "i wanted to love it but it 's pretty pricey for a sweatshirt & the key hole in the back with the bright pink ribbon just looks odd . the stitching & beaded detail around the bottom hem & the cuffs is gorgeous but the sleeves were way too long on me and just looked silly . unfortunately this will be going back ."
__label__0 "i bought this in the grey as shown in the photo as i 'm not fond of horizontal stripes and i felt the striping would distract from the floral accent of this tee . the gray is light and as pictured in the photo . i bought an xl and the fit is tailored with some loose flow to it . it is not boxy or big on me . the fabric is a soft soft thin cotton knit and very cool for hot muggy summer days .... esp . in the southern us where it can be pretty intense . since i bought the gray it 's not sheer al"
__label__-1 "very beautiful colors unfortunately the cut is much too tent- like and it looks like a maternity top on me . i like a flowy bohemian top but this one was too much for my tastes sadly i sent it back ."
__label__0 "another shirt i really wanted to love . i adore green but so few tops are made in this color . ( please make more ! ! ) however this shirt did n't work for me . i think it 's a matter of where your curves live . the shirt was true to size but my boobs meant i was showing more cleavage than the model and the top part felt more like a bib than embroidery . sad coz it is lovely and feels lovely on . probably a great shirt for different body types . would love to see more green clothing ...."
__label__0 "great item and very feminine . can be dressed up or down and fits true to size ."
__label__0 "cute pants not for me . a petite size may have changed my mind . more like ankle pants on my 5 ' 2 frame and a bit large all over . that said the fabric is stretchy and they would be super comfortable . love the snaps on the waistband classy casual ."
__label__-1 "the colors are so much brighter than pictured . although the sweater is very comfortable i did not like the color combination . i will be returning it ."
__label__-1 "i tried this shirt in the purple motif it fit true to size my normal small worked well . all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in . really ? on a white shirt ? it annoyed me so much i did n't buy the shirt ."
__label__1 "this dress is lovely . i 'm tempted to buy it in all of the patterns that i like but i 'm forcing myself to be economical . ( i check regularly to see if it 's on sale however ! then they 're all mine ! ) this dress is soft comfortable classy and has the unique feature of having a low-cut back . my only complaint is that the holes for the arms droop sometimes so reveal my bra . this could be from my shape however because i am rather busty . the dress runs true to size and is easy to clean . it 's one o"
__label__1 "i love this top . very comfortable fabric and it can be worn in multiple ways . it is tight on the bottom . i usually wear an xs ( 5 ' 4 and 120 lbs ) . had to exchange for a small . very flattering . liked it so much i ordered it in both colors ."
__label__0 "as other reviewers have noted this is a pretty top . i really love the design . alas however it is too big for my frame . for reference i am barely 5 ' 1 and about 105 lbs . i ordered my usual xxsp and the fit is just not flattering on me . it is looser than on the model and the flounce does not hit me in the proper place . the top is also too wide so that it has these odd gaps near the armpits . i highly recommend this top unless you are an xxsp . i am going to have to part with it sadly ."
__label__-1 "received this product with a gaping hole in it . very disappointed in the quality and the quality control at the warehouse"
__label__0 "a cute top . the peplum seam hits me at the right spot on my waist . for my curvy figure this is n't always the case . i also am drawn to tanks that i can actually wear a bra underneath without showing bra straps . i usually vary between a medium and a large in deletta but definitely needed a large . i ordered the lavender color which is disappointing ; a dull gray . i 've decided to return and order the coral instead ."
__label__1 "t.la got it right this time . love the fabric . the color is perfect for summer and the color is a great shade of green . exactly as pictured . the left side has a slight cut with silver buttons . exactly as it looks on line . i certainly recommend this top . love it ."
__label__-1 "it fits super baggy everywhere and looked sloppy on me ."
__label__1 "beautiful dress i like the length and cut . nice material . runs a bit big . i think it 'll look nice with a belt . great colors ."
__label__1 "i am so glad i read the reviews for this before i purchased it . i am 5 ' 5 and 135 pounds and normally wear a size 6 in dresses . i would normally buy a small but sized down to an xs and it was perfect ! it 's a beautiful dress and very flattering !"
__label__0 "this is an oversized tee with a somewhat flattering fit . material is very thin . i ordered white which was completely see-through . not at all what i was expecting . might work better in a darker color but i returned it since it was nothing special ."
__label__0 "this shirt is cute nice cut but i do n't love it . best as a sleeping tank ."
__label__1 "this dress pops ! gorgeous colors and simple classic flowy design . i thought it ran a little big i ended up with xs for best overall fit in chest and a more streamline flow . 34b for reference ."
__label__0 "i love these pants but they run super big and still stretch after wearing . i am usually a 2/ 26 and had to get a 0. also the pocket flaps stick up on the corners and ironing doesnt help . still comfortable but i would have never paid full price for these if i had known ."
__label__-1 "the design and quality were great . i really wanted them to fit but they ran large . i 'm 5 ' 4 and 120 lbs and orderd the small . unfortunately the fit seemed off as well and i wo n't be trying a size down . the waist and hips were huge but the thigh area was fitted enough that a smaller size would have been awkward . sadly these went back ."
__label__-1 "this dress is thin and completely see through . it is definitely not worth the price tag . would be really cute in a thicker material ."
__label__0 "i carry my weight on my lower half usually a large in bottoms . this one in a large was too big throughout especially since it does n't have a waste band . returned ."
__label__0 "i fell in love with these online . i thought they would be such a nice piece of statement denim . unfortunately they did not work for me . i am 5 ' 2 and the waist of these paints was four inches away from my breasts . it did n't look bad from the back but from the front it was comical . the denim itself is nice and heavy but like the previous reviewer stated not a dark wash. the pair i received was a medium whiskered wash. if i was taller these would have been a yes despite the wash discrepancy ."
__label__1 "absolutely gorgeous ! i bought my regular size m and while it 's a little wide in the shoulders it drapes beautifully . because i 'm so short i found the sleeves too long so i took it to my dressmaker and she shortened the sleeves about two inches so it 's still elbow length and while i was there she put in two small darts in the back so make it less boxy for my frame . ca n't wait to wear it - it 's a beautiful material and i love the combo of the metallic sheen and velvet . so elegant . very gatsby"
__label__-1 "soooo disappointed in this dress . the colors are beautiful for fall . the fabric feels luxe . the slip fits perfectly . the dress however is a hot mess . it is easily two times more fabric than needed to create a flow-y aline dress . huge everywhere . under the arms and waist and hips . it 's just an enormous tent . i am 5 ' 8 128 lbs . i ordered my usual size small . i looked shapeless in this . i ca n't think of any body type it would flatter . potentially women quite far along in their pregnancy ."
__label__-1 "cut out design no seems or hems . very disappointed in retailer"
__label__0 "i was so excited to get this dress and could tell right away it was beautiful . the fabric and detail are perfect and seem great for summer . then i tried it on .... to say the bust area is tight and not proportioned correctly would be putting it very nicely . it was a total joke . this dress is for very small chested only ."
__label__0 "i knew i would love this dress it looked so me ! my order arrived and sadly to say it looks awful i was expecting 3/4 sleeves these were to the bottom of my wrist . i could have been fine with that but the entire dress was so big on me . it looked like a sack . i usually wear a sz 4 or s/m this was a small . will return . if you can find one that fits i would recommend it ."

__label__-1 "i ordered the taupe version of this tee which was a medium brown with black stripes . the fabric felt itchy and rough and was pretty sheer for not being light colored . i did n't care for the fit which was extremely boxy and wide ; from the picture i expected an a-line fit but not a wide drop with webbed underarms . i ordered 2 sizes and could have worn the smaller if i 'd kept this tee . it runs on the larger side . what astounded me most was that both tees i ordered were sewn with completely cro"
__label__1 "this sweater is so unique . not for the faint of heart but it 's beautiful . hubby thought pattern looked southeast asian inspired . the colors are saturated vibrant . love the raglan sleeves and the tweed on the sleeves and in the back . the front material is slightly stiffer . i feel like i have a little bit more bulk in the stomach area than i want but i 'm willing to overlook it . will be a great sweater for the holiday season . wear it with a skirt jeans skinny cargos . endless possibilities ."
__label__0 "when i tried it on it looked like a stiff bathrobe . straight too boxy ."
__label__1 "this dress is adorable ! it fits loose and is not at all fitted with the exception of the under cami lining . the picture showing front and back is being pulled to fit . : / it fits like the model wearing the purple . my local store was out of my normal size so i sized up which really made no difference at all . the biggest difference would be the under cami . the dress is flowy and airy . one of the best casual dresses retailer has had in a long time . obviously the blue is sold out till may . this can b"

__label__1 "i ordered this shirt last week and i wore it as soon as it arrived . it is a beautiful shirt with an original design . it is rather casual but you can dress it up with the right accessories . the print appears to be navy ( it was advertised as black ) and it looks great with jeans . i would certainly recommend this item ."
__label__1 "these jeans not only fit well i love the way the fabric feels . for denim the fabric feels soft on the skin . i am 5 ' 8 and the inseam of 30 inches was perfect . they call them hi-rise but them seem more like a mid-rise to me which i prefer . i am going to buy another pair in a different wash ."
__label__0 "due to the black sheath being out of stock in all sizes ( for quite some time ) i took my chances ordering an 8p in navy which was way too big on me . i also didnt love the navy . i wish i could try the 6 or 6p in black but out of stock and would n't arrive in time for my events . sadly returning ."

__label__-1 "tried this on at my local retailer the red color is pretty but not a true red . the fabric has a nice weight to it not the usual thin stuff that retailer seems to offer these days . two big problems though- the top is very low cut and i could see it opening up to the world ! and the armholes are cut so big and low that you could see the sides of my bra this is a deal-breaker for me it ca n't be fixed ."
__label__0 "i 'm pretty tan and i always have to be careful with white tops or pants . i love the embroidery detail but this top is practically see-through for me . it is double-lined but i could still see my bra . very pretty though and i was disappointed that it did n't work for me ."
__label__-1 "i had to review this because i purchased before any reviews were up and now that i 've received this dress i 'm appalled by all the positive reviews ! ! ! this dress is hideous in person . seriously hideous . and even if you can get past the drapery fabric it 's incredibly restricting . the picture online is so misleading . the dress is n't even an ivory it 's more of a pea green ! so disappointed ."
__label__1 "i like this sweater very much . it 's short but not too short and soft but not fluffy . the design is a little interesting rather than plain and the colors ( i ordered the tan ) are great for me a redhead . i 'm 5 ' 3 125 lbs and do n't like clingy tops so i took a m and it 's perfect . really cutewith jeans ."
__label__1 "this is a very well made top i like the cut and it fits true to size . very nice quality and the colors schemes are unique . i 'm happy with this purchase ."

__label__0 "i saw this dress in the store months ago and never forgot it so when i saw it on sale i nabbed it online . so sad to see how this dress fits : just right up top just right along the hem and then it 's a hot potato-sack-frump mess in the middle . it 's a shame because the fabric is beautiful ."
__label__1 "love these ! loose and comfy everywhere . delighted to have found a 32 and delighted that they are roomy even at the waist . i exchanged another pair of pilcro 's and was afraid of a shipping/pricing conflict but as usual retailer customer service was excellent . earlier sale price was honored easy returns in the orignal shipping bag .. retailer design fashion and company attitude excels !"
__label__-1 "cute and very soft but the elastic was n't sewn in right . i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess . disappointing for more expensive loungewear ."
__label__-1 "ordered this top online as i loved the colors and design but i should have listened to the other reviewers . i ordered my usual size m and it was just very unflattering . it was short and wide not at all like it 's pictured on the model . needless to say it was immediately shipped back ."
__label__1 "this is the softest shirt super comfy very baggy but i 'd say true to size for the style . it is a bit thin and i 'm worried how it will hold up or would have given the full 5 stars . i 'm not a usual fan of the turtle neck but this is so soft i love it !"
__label__0 "i really liked this cardigan when i saw it today . the cut and detail in the back is slimming and very flattering . i love the idea of the safety pin closure and i really like how the model wears it in this photo-open with the pin on the side . when i saw this in-store it was closed in the front with the pin which i also like . i thought for sure the cardigan was also pinned in back when i saw it in the model so it looked fantastic . however when i tried it on myself it was n't quite the same ."
__label__-1 "this skirt is very pretty but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized so there 's very little stretch . for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements there 's no way to get this skirt on past the hips ."

__label__-1 "i loved this dress and the color . i wanted to wear it to my niece 's wedding . i usually wear a medium but could n't get it on . the large was perfect in the top but too tight in the hips for a wedding even with spanks . the xl was perfect is the hips in that it did n't cut but the top was huge . i really do n't understand the sizing of this dress at all ."
__label__1 "i saw this dress online and b-lined it to the store to try on . it is a beautifully made dress . lots of great detail with stitching and beading on the front placket . feels very boho and chic . i have received lots of compliments while wearing this dress . i was almost turned off by the price but decided to see it in person . worth every penny . wear it with sandals or tall boots could have worn a medium but a little tight for 38c on top ."

__label__0 "for the price of this tee the beautiful front lattice work should have been extended onto the back . would have been a classier more finished looking garment . if the cost is not an issue then this tee makes a nice neutral addition to a neat but casual summer look ."
__label__-1 "like another reviewer mentioned this shirt is way too short . i 'm only 5 ' 2 ( xs ) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model . also the quality is n't great as it 's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front . it 's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique . sadly it 's going back !"
__label__-1 "i 'm 5 ' 5 150 lbs 32dd normally a 28p or 29p in pants . i ordered an 8 and probably should have gone with a 10. it was super unflattering ? the print was overwhelming for my pale skin it made my thin waist look larger than it really was and rode up the inside of my thighs . i have a similar bathing suit from modcloth that 's 1/3 of the price and 20x as flattering . if you have thick legs this may not be the suit for you . i returned it -- so fast ."
__label__-1 "i love the fit of these pants -- they 're the perfect slim black pants . however i wore these pants exactly three times before the seams split the middle of the pant in not just one but multiple places . disappointed by the workmanship/quality of the product especially since the pants fit amazingly and do n't sag like other slim fitting black pants tend to do . i hope retailer will take this into consideration and improve the quality of future iterations of this product ."
__label__0 "i 'm a consistent size 6 ( ordered a small ) with a pretty athletic build ( wide shoulders and strong arms ) and this dress simply did not fit with those proportions . the sleeves and back were far too tight . additionally the bow did not cover my bra strap likely because it is n't made for someone my height . had to return ."
__label__-1 "i saw this in the store and was glad i did n't order it earlier online . i thought it would be beautifully stitched but it was rather flat and unimpressive in person . i like more unusual and flattering pieces and this just was n't it . no compliments here ."
__label__1 "i saw this dress on the cashier at retailer and had to order it . it is as one of the reviewers said like having two dresses in one . the bottom dress is a full dress and the top lays over it not quite skimming but not quite loose either . i love the dress as i am a pear shaped size 14 and this helps to camouflage some bumps nicely . this dress reminds of the dresses some peasant women wear in rural countries ."

__label__-1 "i thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on it is so big on the bottom it looks like a tent . i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big . sad ."
__label__0 "i loved the look of this top the moment i saw it in the store particularly the muted red color . the crochet detail is very pretty and i found the fit to be quite flattering on me . however part of the crochet detail on the one i received has a hole that needs to be repaired . since i purchased during the sale i 'm going to try and mend myself but this may end up having to go back . if you see this in store and find one that is not damaged i would recommend it !"

__label__0 "the sleeves were very tight in the upper arm area but the body was blousy too blousy so to go up a size for the arms would mean it would be very oversized in the body . i like the fabric ( nice and thick ) but it did not work for me ."

__label__-1 "i was so excited to order this dress . i loved that it had a normal neck nice length and there was n't a hole in the back . but this dress is just plain awful . the top fit tight across the bust it flattened me out like i was wearing a too tight sports bra . then the back zipper puckered and bumped up like there is too much zipper for the fabric . i could not get the zipper to lay flat . the fabric is itchy and very cheap feeling . on top of it all the colors are much brighter than they appear in the"

__label__-1 "ugh the fit of this dress is terrible : / what a beautiful dress though -- the material and the colors -- had so much potential . but the fit is awful -- i ordered by regular size and the top was more or less ok if not a tad big but hip down was crazy tight that i could n't even zip it without a ton of effort . i do n't think sizing up will help because then the top will be even bigger . disappointing ."

__label__-1 "pretty design but when i tried it on the fabric was thin and delicate . i do n't think it would last long with much wear . too bad . if the fabric were sturdier it 'd be great as the cut is flattering and i love the pockets ."
__label__-1 "this top was too big for me . 5 ' 4 135lbs and ordered xxs . fit was fine and wanted it too work but too overwhelming on me as well . will be going back ."

__label__1 "i 'm glad they put up some pix of non-models looking cute in this dress as it 's taken a beating in the reviews ! i measure 34 ( a ) -27-35 and have no problems with the size s fit at all . it 's drapey but not voluminous with no pulling at the hips . the folded detail up at the top does call attention to the shoulders but not in a bad way . the pleated neckline is cute on a small chest and the red pattern/palette is awesome . love the length too -- i am 5 ' 4 & the size s hits me just above the knee ."

__label__-1 "i was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person . the fabric is a rough gauzy texture . the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something they do not hang or move well on the body . also they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off . sadly these are going back ."
__label__-1 "it just did n't work for me . i do n't know if it is my fair complexion and untanned legs but this dress was a strike out . the orange floral design and beading is beautiful and the fitting i would say is pretty tts . for reference i am 5 ' 7 and 145lbs with 36 30 40 measurements and i purchased a medium . the chest and arms were not too tight like other reviews stated . the length is about the length in the picture and a lot of fabric to make it very flowy . overall very good quality and beautiful"

__label__-1 "i really like this dress/shirt . it 's great for layering super cute and will hide my traditional holiday and this year 's pregnancy weight gain . i think it will be so cute with some leggings and boots . unfortunately the back panel of the dress does not seem to vary based on the size . this may sound weird but i 've tried on an 8 and a 10 and the ability to reach forward did n't change between the two sizes . i just returned the 10 and am hopeful the 12 i ordered will be slightly roomier in the back ."
__label__-1 "this is an adorable basic & i should have been wearing it once a week this summer but instead the fabric developed noticeable holes after the very first wear . this brand makes some of the softest cutest tees but unfortunately more often than not are unwearable after the first or second wash. i wash on gentle & hang dry . not worth the cost ."
__label__-1 "i love this brand and the material of these shirts and have a ton similar and thought this was adorable with the sweet detail but it is super short and boxy and i felt uncomfortable with the length on me and it also made it so it was n't so flattering on . such a bummer cuz its a sweet spin on a plain basic tee !"
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this product so badly . i ordered it in the mail and it looked beautiful coming out of the box . i normally look really nice in grey but this color really washed me out and was not nice on . the fabric is very sheer so you would have to wear it over a camisole/tank top . this is one of those pieces that looks better on the hanger than in person . large in arms small on body . odd fit ."

__label__-1 "this is a very awkward and unflattering shirt . i am very petite -- 90 pounds and 5 ' 2 . the arms fit -- length and width but nothing else about this fit . the scoop was so low and wide that i would require a shirt underneath . it fell exactly like a tent and made a bell shape around my thighs . yikes ! it looks cute on the model but not on me . the material is also very thin and felt sort of like it should be a pajama top ."

__label__0 "i ordered the navy/gray combo in size xl . it was too heavy and uncomfortable to wear . it also attracted so much lint . the one i received must have come from a store because it already had a lot of fuzz on it . it added weight and was unflattering for my shape . the colors do match the photos online . the length also matches the model 's photos . it just did n't work for me ."
__label__-1 "the quality of the garment is high -- a nice substantial yarn and a pretty crochet pattern but the cut was totally off for me . i 'm usually an xs/s and was swimming in the xs . the arms in particular were huge and drapey and the whole thing just hung on me ( for reference i 'm 5 ' 4 120 lbs ) ."
__label__-1 "i agree with the other reviewers - the fabric is beautiful - although i wish they would start making blouses again that did n't require you to wear a cami underneath because of sheerness . i mean for the price should n't it be lined or something . when did our expectations on fabric quality get so low . but i knew going in that it would be sheer so i ca n't really complain too much . plus they are so loosely sewn on that after 20 minutes and only half the buttons undone one fell off . i gave up at that"

__label__1 "i wanted these leggings to wear under dresses during winter to keep my legs warm . they get the job done and for an incredible price . they are soft and lined with fleece on the inside . i 'm not sure the ribbing on the black is necessary but it 's subtle and i do n't mind it . they are a tad long on my petite frame but since i intend to tuck them into boots the length not a problem . my only quibble is that my first pair arrived with three snags on one leg . retailer kindly sent me a new pair for"
__label__0 "i 'm undecided about this shirt . this design is absolutely beautiful . but the shirt is very very sheer and the front comes down so low in a curved hem line . so when you wear the necessary base layer the shirt extends several inches beyond that and it looks kind of odd . i really wish tiny would make some beautiful shirts like this that are n't sheer and have a shorter front . i purchased my regular size and it fits a little smaller than other tiny shirts i have purchased . since the shirt is so bea"

__label__1 "i saw this top online and loved it . i was n't sure about sizing and because i do n't live near a store i decided to order two sizes . i 'm 5 ' 8 and typically wear an 8 or medium in tops . the 8 in this top though was much too tight in the shoulders . i sized up to a 10 and it fit beautifully !"
__label__-1 "really disappointing quality . these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month ! i love pilcros and am totally shocked at the poor quality ... retailer i hope this is just a fluke . not worth the money !"
__label__1 "i saw this duster and immediately ordered it in cream . i have worn it every chance i get . it goes well with dresses as well as shorts or jeans . the length is perfect the design is flattering and the material is soft and comfortable . the sleeves are snug- but i like this feature especially for light weight summer use over a tank top or sleeveless blouse . this will be a go to item . thanks retailer- another gem !"
__label__-1 "this is another item i 've been stalking that i thought miraculously made it to sale with my size still available . i ordered online but when it arrived i have to be honest i did n't even try it on because i knew it would be going back . the beautiful print online looks really cheap irl on the flimsy fabric . the beaded detail on neck is basically a low grade sequin trim . so much potential just executed poorly ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this dress however it has no shape to it . it is also somewhat see through so something needs to be worn under it . i feel like i received a dress that has been stretched out and returned . i 'm extremely disappointed . i do not recommend ."
__label__-1 "i bought this t-shirt in pink blue red grey and black over the past year . every one of them except the grey has gotten little pin holes in the front of the shirt below your waistline . i 've returned them all . the fabric is thin and the quality of the t/shirt is terrible ."

__label__0 "this seemed to run a little bit small on me ... more form fitting than on the model in the photo . also it 's thin . i 'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look . the lace applique is pretty and if you purchase it for that then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black ."
__label__0 "color not as vibrant as in the picture . skirt is darted which is not clearly seen in the picture . ( assumed would be cut on the bias which i 'm more familiar with in slip dresses . ) i did n't fill in the bust and the style is such that it is n't possible to compensate with helpful undergarments . while not for me i 'm still recommending it because it may fit others better . reviewers are instructed to avoid writing about customer service but i feel compelled to note that the customer service i have"

__label__0 "this was a fail for me . although i ordered size large it barely fit my midsection when tied and was too small in the waist . the fabric is nice though . best on thinner frames than mine ."
__label__0 "i got this dress in hopes of having a really nice winter formal dress . it was not well made at all ! the lining did n't line up with the top layer and the waist puffed out in uneven places . i am curvy so a puffy waistline in the last thing i need ! the fabric itself is very nice but just not well made . i do not recommend this dress ."
__label__1 "i thought the dress in store for true to size and was a bit more 'swinging ' style . i am 5 ' 7 athletic and the small fit perfect ."
__label__0 "this dress is gorgeous but the cut of the neck and arms is designed for girls with a slim frame only . i wish it worked ? the fabric and pattern are beautiful . sad to send it back ."
__label__1 "this looks beautiful and fits true-to-size . the material has enough weight so that it hangs well . this is a very form-fitting dress - i would n't recommend it to someone uncomfortable with a close fitting style ."
__label__1 "absolutely love this in blue . the cut and fit are flowy while still having a flattering shape . the colors and pattern are accurate on screen - vibrant and rich . the tie front is a pretty detail allowing the top to feel a little dressy . very happy with this purchase !"
__label__0 "this is a nice choice for holiday gatherings . i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings . the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust . in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up ( but then perhaps the waist will be too big ) . the problem with this dress is the quality . the fabrics are terrible . the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip"
__label__-1 "this skirt is beautiful . fabric is gorgeous with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it . there is a life in this skirt ; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way . or i better say it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it . unfortunately it stretched more than a full size and generally lost its shape . now the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore ."

__label__0 "this is a super cute tunic - it is simply way too big ."
__label__1 "what a perfect summer dress ! after reading the previous review i ordered a size up and it 's perfect . the slip is a little snug on the hips but most dresses are on me so i think on most people it would fit very well as long as you ordered one size larger . i ca n't wait to wear this while traveling through europe next summer !"
__label__1 "i love the way this fits and feels on . it is a beautiful piece and makes me happy to wear . i ordered my usual size medium and it fits well . the only con is that it is dry clean only ."

__label__-1 "this looks so gorgeous on the model on the site so i ordered it online . it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on . looks like i took a floor rug cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head . the sweater itself is so pretty its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me . i normally wear a small so i ordered the xs/s and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs . its kind of itchy too . will be returning this asap ."
__label__0 "good structure and quality ; a bit large and wish i had ordered something a bit brighter ! ( i ordered the white tee . )"

__label__0 "this shirt is beautiful however i thought that it was made of a softer lighter material . it is instead made of a thick heavy material that was unflattering for my shape . ( short torso ann 's large bust ) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle . sadly i 'll be returning it ."
__label__1 "this jumpsuit is the epitome of what i love about retailer ! unique and absolutely beautiful . i love how it flows and on my petite frame when paired with heels makes me look taller . hopefully the designs for spring/summer are just as beautiful and comfortable as this piece . i plan to rock this with a cute belt and a bolo jacket ."

__label__-1 "i own some pure and good cotton tanks similar to this in black that i live in teaching dance . i was hoping these would be the same . i ordered the pale blue and it is completely see through and fits tight in the back and loose in the front . i have no desire to have a bra/sports bra show whether out the sides or through the fabric it is tacky !"
__label__-1 "it 's nice material but the design makes you look like a pregnant lady"

__label__-1 "you have to be a contortionist to get this bra on . it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows . ridiculously impractical . why oh why did n't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead ?"
__label__1 "this skirt is gorgeous- the picture does n't do it justice . it has beautiful sparkle and glitter in the material . i received tons of compliments on it . the biggest downside is the material- it seems to snag and pull so easily . in a short 2 hours of wearing it the material was already pulled in two different places . i will keep the skirt because it is so pretty but have to not get upset when the material gets worse over time ."
__label__1 "i just bought this top in size medium and i love it . super comfortable and flowy . if you want to dry it in the machine just put cold air and it wo n't shrink . do n't use hot air ..."
__label__1 "i bought a size xl in the white with brighter small florals . i paid full-price as a splurge for summer . the details on the top are just as nice in person as shown in the photos . it 's a sweet top . i love the upper portion . however it runs long . i need to belt it/tuck it or it looks strangely like a long-tunic . the floral material is slippery and a little heavy . not the softest but it 's washed well . i love the mix of laces at the top . it 's pretty . not worth full-price but on sale it 's worth tryi"
__label__0 "love the detail of the white with yellow underneath but agree with the other reviewer that the material is very thin in the back . also it is a flowly top so you will need to size down . however because of the shape it will fit snuggly around the chest/arms . this did n't work for me as it accentuated my normal body type ( as in not the model type ) . i am not overweight but it definitely did n't flatter my chest area . seems like the top worked for others so i suggest trying on first ."
__label__1 "i usually wear a medium and this jacket was no exception . the jacket is a shorter style as pictured . it is still flattering even though it is a little boxy . i got the grey which is a dark gray/slight greige color . if you like edgier over boho this is a cute transitional jacket ."
__label__0 "i thought the quality of the fabric was good and liked the idea of wearing it either with opening in front or back . it was a little larger then i was expecting and i wish it had a closure ( hook and eye or snap ) at the top . it has three places in the back to tie together and when i tied them in a bow they came loose easily . overall glad i bought it ."
__label__0 "really unique & will easily go with many tops/bottoms . i agree with the other reviewers it 's itchy but so super cute . the sale price is a good deal . i had already planned to wear with long sleeves so the itchy fabric should not be a problem . i got the xs/s my usual size ."
__label__0 "i purchased the blouse in both the ivory and black . the black i decided to keep because it will go with anything . i was hoping the ivory blouse would work but it 's thin and see through . if someone could please tell me where i could find a casual white or ivory blouse that is not entirely see through i would greatly appreciate it !"
__label__0 "cute print on both sides but far more cheek was exposed than i anticipated from the photos . the front is n't too skimpy but the back is a bit too small for my taste . definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut . too bad : ( the matching top is my favorite top so i guess i 'll just have to wear black bottoms with it ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this online and was disappointed when it arrived . it did n't look quite like it does in the photos online . it also runs small . i returned it because i did not feel it was worth the high price ."
__label__0 "they were too small for me . i loved them other than that ."
__label__0 "it 's okay for a coverup or beach dress and lounging around the house . it 's comfy and i like the detail of the back . the front is very plain but okay . it 's not too baggy and it 's a straight cut . the detail in the back makes it a keeper for me but only as a casual dress too chill at home or quick errands to grocery store ."
__label__0 "loved almost everything about this top . the colors are great comfortable fit but the length was a little too long for my 5 ' 4 frame . i also was n't a big fan of the large side slit . i would still recommend this great top ."
__label__-1 "this style is right up my alley and i was excited to receive it . however it is seriously overpriced . i ordered the white and the material is thin and see-through . the small was even a bit roomy ( 5 ' 7 140lbs 32dd ) . going back unfortunately ."
__label__-1 "i got this sweater with high hopes to wear it with some leggings for christmas . it looked adorable ( and long ! ) on the model . however it does n't even cover my butt that 's how short it is . if you 're anything over 5 ' 4 i 'd say it 'll be too short for leggings ."

__label__-1 "the color and quality of this sweater are fantastic . the reason i only gave it two stars is that the height of the neck did n't seem right to me . it looked awkward and too high to be left standing upright but when folded over i wished it were higher so it formed more of a turtleneck/cowl . i will be returning the sweater because of that ."
__label__-1 "received this in the mail today and was disappointed . i typically wear a 6/8 but bought this in the 8 as i had purchased another similar top from the same company in an 8. this does not fit the same at all . the top pulled in my shoulder and chest area while had ample room in the body . needless to say i will be returning this item"
__label__-1 "i had really high hopes for this shirt after reading the reviews . first off it runs really small . i usually wear a small or medium ( 4 or 6 ) i could n't even get the 6 on . i probably could have even done a 10. the fabric was extremely flimsy . i was almost afraid i was going to rip it taking it off . other than the sizing and the fabric it just was n't flattering on me ."
__label__0 "this sweater is fine for the casual days . i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old . i 'm a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them . this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears . very soft but poor material . not my favorite purchase ."
__label__0 "wanted to love this one so badly but did n't work for me . just looks really wide on me -- looks amazing on the model though !"
__label__-1 "i ordered these in both colors . the red is much deeper in person more like a burgundy than pictured here . these tees are very slouchy . if you wanted a more fitted look size down . these are very soft and very comfy and will pair well with ponte leggings and skinny jeans . the overall quality seems very good although they are thinner than i thought they would be ( they seemed like they would be thick and stiff to me based on the photos ) . -- -- -- -- -- overall these are very nice . but there is one is"
__label__-1 "i really wanted to like this ... it 's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue but that 's where the positives end . i ordered the xs and it was huge . wide shapeless and way too long ( i 'm 105lbs and 5 ' 1 ) . even if it came in petite i 'm not sure it 's worth the price because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out ."
__label__-1 "i thought this was adorable on the model but not so much on me . i actually did n't mind it when i tried it on with a long cardigan but i did n't want to keep it for 1 look . the material felt inexpensive . the shape was very unflattering for an average sized women like myself . i 'm 5 ' 8 and about 160 lbs ."
__label__-1 "this top is beautiful in design but sadly i will be returning . it is hand wash and even after doing so i had 2 unraveled threads resulting in large holes . unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing ."
__label__1 "this product i better than the pic . nice fit and a nice throw on with boots nap glad i took a chance one it"
__label__0 "this shirt is adorable love the lace detail on the sides but way too boxy for me . it 's a great lighter weight for spring but it does n't feel flimsy . sadly there is n't any shape to help make this flattering . it will be returned ."
__label__0 "i was really excited for this dress to come and hoped it would work well for a couple of holiday parties that i will be going to this season . i was n't sure what i thought when trying it on but i am thinking it will go back since i still am not super excited about it . for me the waistline was a bit high and it had a bit of a frumpy feel . i love the floral pattern but overall it just was n't amazing ."
__label__1 "crazy soft and comfy . light weight so will be great for spring/ summer and layering . so happy i bought it ."
__label__1 "these are my favourite sleep pants . the waist band shrinks with every wash even without drying all the way on low . i normally wear a small and ended up getting the large so the waist band did n't cut in my sides ."
__label__0 "i was really excited about this romper and when it arrived it looks just like the picture . the torso was abnormally long and i get this is supposed to be a relaxed fit but it sagged way too much for my liking . i 'm 5 ' 9 32c and i wear 28 size pants usually i struggle with too short of a torso in romper/jumpsuits but not this one . i ordered a medium and felt like it was way too big . i probably could have gone down a size but i was n't loving it enough to try . the fabric is nice but the tiny clasp"

__label__1 "pretty top . quality material it is not thin and see through . size down because this runs large . although it is meant to be flowy if you do n't size down the arm holes will show your bra and the rest of the body will have too much fabric looking too boxy and unflattering ."
__label__-1 "i bought this dress online and was hoping it would be a great comfortable staple .. it may be the most unflattering piece of clothing i have ever tried on ever ! i let my sisters try it on too to see if they wanted it or liked it better but it was awful on them as well . i ordered the xs in blue . it was beyond enormous and was just plain and unflattering . i am 5 ' 7 ' and 115. i love swing dresses i just do n't think is cut well ."
__label__-1 "my husband never has anything negative to say about my clothes until i wore these pants ! they are not flattering and kept stretching out until i could pull them off without unzipping them ! baggy in the behind and sloppy looking . they are going back asap !"

__label__-1 "i love the pattern adn color combo but wow t really flatering on me . too much fabric . i felt like i was trying to hide wight gain or pregnancy or wearing a mumu . anyway not for me but others might toll wnat to try in case it was just me ... too bad . length was decent in regulat size though not too long . just too wide ."
__label__0 "this is a busy dress that makes me think boho-glam holly hobby . i bought my usual size and it looks like nightmare of a nightgown on me . i 'm going to try a size smaller in the hopes i will love it more . i 'm recommending this dress for those that like the quirky whimsical hippie eclectic crafty style ."
__label__0 "the material of the shirt and the ties are two different materials . the shirt is a very soft cotton but the ties are of a more dressier material . i expected the shirt to be of the dressier material . overall it is a cute shirt just not what i expected ."
__label__0 "i got this top in my typical size medium and wanted to love it ... it is such a good idea and i loved it on the model ! however it failed in translation for me and i will be returning . the bottom of the top is very loose but the top clings to my chest ( 36dd ) pulling awkwardly and gapping on the sides . not worth exchanging for a large since the bottom of the top is already to loose .."
__label__1 "this is very unique and stylish ! the embroidery is stunning plus it is extremely comfortable . it is pretty warm . it does not itch me at all as others have noted ."
__label__-1 "cute in the on line photo but in person it looks cheap and has gold running through it . if you look really close in the photo you can see it ."
__label__1 "i love how soft and substantial the fabric is . the fabric has a nice weight and drapes beautifully . the ruffle detail is very flattering . i have broad shoulders and this top looks great ."
__label__0 "i really liked the style of this top but it 's way oversized ! i 'm petite and drowned in this top even though i got it in an xs . the material is nice but i ca n't see i had a feeling for the cut because it runs so big . this one is going back to the store !"
__label__1 "this top is extremely well made . the fabric is so soft . the style is very stylish . it is very figure flattering and chic . a keeper ! i 'm petite and the style is not overwhelming ."
__label__-1 "this dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it . i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available . the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed . however the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky . i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering ."
__label__-1 "very sheer inexpensive material . even on sale i 'm returning it"
__label__1 "snapped this sweet puppy up at my local retailer-in the sale room ! ! ! ! ! it is beyond fabulous and the coral color is divine ! ! ! ! brightens up the drearriest of days-i did size down . i am short and the small sleeves were way too long on my 5ft3in frame . it runs a bit large but if you were to wear a heavier something under it i could see getting your normal size . the quality is great and the style is just lovely . great jacket-love love love"
__label__0 "i returned this as it was way too boxy/loose . ordered a size small but probably needed to size down ."
__label__1 "this was on display when walked into my local retailer it 's just a beautiful in person . my mistake was trying it on instant love ! i tried on my usual size small & it fit perfectly . i would usually wait for something in this price range to go on sale but i just had to have this . worth the splurge !"
__label__1 "i love this dress ! my goal is to have a closet full of clothes that are really cute and stylish but are also very comfortable ... this dress fit the bill . the mixture of the fabrics is even more cute in person than it looks online and the fabric is so soft it almost feel like wearing pajamas . the weight of the fabric also makes it hang really nicely and so it 's flattering . overall a great addition to my spring/summer wardrobe ."
__label__-1 "this one will be going back . the color is really blah and the fabric was n't a texture i was expecting -- it is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day . overall the cut and style is cute but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style . this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric ."
__label__-1 "what a disappointment and for the price it 's outrageous !"
__label__-1 "very disappointed . the cutouts started to rip the first time i wore it . i 've only worn it twice and i love it but the cut outs are embarrassing ."

__label__-1 "i bought a petite medium and the length was right but it fit like a potato sack . it was quite comfortable and did n't look completely terrible from the front but from the side it was terribly unflattering . when i tried it on my boyfriend saw it and said it looked like i was wearing a nightie . i do n't do form-fitting clothing but this was the exact opposite and flared out every which way . it 's got to go back ."

__label__1 "i agree with the other reviewer -- this is classic retailer old-style quality . the lining inside is soft to the touch and the colors are vividly magical . the only reason i am not pining for it is the odd balloon-fit of the waist . i usually choose s/m in cardigans ( for ref 5 ' 8 135 lbs 34-b ) but even the small of this sweater-coat dwarfed me . i think it just depends what you are looking for . unique it is and certainly lovely ."
