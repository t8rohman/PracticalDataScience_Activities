-1,If you like to wear lampshades this is the shirt for you. beyond unflattering. boxy and seriously looks like lace was stitched to the bottom of a lampshade,Blouses
-1,Cute in theory  i love the bright colors  the tied black collar sash and the 70's vibe  however  the fabric is cheap  and the worst part in my view is that the seams that run along the front center of the shirt do not align the pattern. maybe this was intentional  but with the shirt i received  it looked horrible. i sent it back. i notice in the picture that the black ties are strategically placed over the center front seam  so it is a bit deceiving. i wouldn't buy this top at any price based on,Blouses
-1,This top is exactly what i was hoping for except it is missing the drawstring. so disappointing  mailing it back.,Blouses
-1,The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it. very disappointing since i love the design. i'm actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger  but annoying that it's come to that.,Blouses
-1,I am very disappointed with this order. the shirt looks and feels cheap  is not flattering in any way. i am sending it back right away.,Blouses
-1,This is a gorgeous top. very well made with a classy design. it fits true to size from the lower chest up. however  at about the mid-belly range  the shirt widens out and basically allows a 5 month twin pregnancy to comfortably fit in. size xs. i was so sad. for the price  i can't justify taking it for alterations. it would have been the perfect top.,Blouses
-1,I liked this top okay but i did not think it was worth full price. i thought it was only average.,Blouses
-1,On my screen this looked like burnt oranges were mixed with pink but this was all pink & very washed put pinks - looked awful on me as brunette. maybe will work for someone who likes pastels. overall style was also disappointing- just hung. this went back.,Blouses
-1,If you are over 25  this top probably is not for you. it is absolutely see-thru. great style and beautiful light fabric  but you can see right thru it.,Blouses
0,Too pricey for the quality of this imported product.,Blouses
0,"Beautiful blouse in theory  however  on my 5'9"" frame it came off like a costume. i truly had a nice chuckle as i looked at myself in the mirror. had to sadly return it",Blouses
0,This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage  so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer  i just couldn't make it work  .,Blouses
0,I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp  that's out the window. this design is poor. for one  this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don't know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so  without a jacket  i would never wear this. it's very low cut..the back is very low..it's a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4.,Blouses
0,I thought this top had shimmery dots  that is what it looks like in the picture. but when it arrived  it looks much plainer in-person and i could not believe it was this top. the dots are polka dots. the embroidery at the v-neck doesn't stand out much in the photo but it does in-person. the top runs true to size but the fit didn't feel as perfect for me. i am sending it back. i needed a more shimmery top.,Blouses
0,First  i absolutely love cloth & stone. but lately i'm finding some of the styles are going in a direction that just doesn't fit my style. that's ok because they still have some good basics.       what i mean is the cut. a lot of their pieces are super long in the back and super short in the front (ie their slip dress they have out right now). this particular tank is like that  although this one is borderline. the sides cut up a little too high for my tastes and i can't help but think i'm wearin,Blouses
0,I so wanted to love this top. i first ordered in the medium because previous reviews said it ran large. i got the medium and it ran so small in the arms that i could almost not get it off with ripping it. so i ordered an xl hoping that would work. unfortunately it ran just as small i'm the arms and i had to return.,Blouses
0,Beautiful but big. i exchanged my 0 for a 00  and  oddly enough  there was no difference! had a similar experience with another 00 blouse. am i crazy  or is the 00 size just a sham?,Blouses
0,The top was very nice and i liked the material. my problem was getting it on with the cami being attached to the top. it took me a while to figure it out. and for that reason alone i returned it.,Blouses
1,Perfect trans top.  skinnies or boyfriend and booties.  love the mixed prints,Blouses
1,I absolutely loved this once i got it out of the package. it's a very vibrant print in the red print  almost a picnic vibe  and the material feels soft and high quality. it runs very large though  i usually take an 8 or maybe a 6  and am busty  and in this i am pretty sure i will need the 4. i almost convinced myself i had lost weight when i tried it on! but i will return the 8 and get the 4 in the red  as well as probably at least one of the other colors as i like it so much.,Blouses
1,This is an eye-catching top and cute design. the xs fit but was extra-billowy for my taste...if you notice on the model it also shows that the back is not fitted and flows behind wider than is normal...a great and breezy style  but for me  sadly it overwhelmed my short frame. the bottom of the ruffle hit me just at the hips which made the top also a tad too short for my taste. i am sure on others it will work and look amazing.,Blouses
1,Another really cute iop (i tried on the blue)  but if you are short  you definitely ned a petite size. sofy fabric  and pretty pattern  like hte tie nexk. too bad they sold out in my size...,Blouses
1,I was eyeing this blouse when the catelog was mailed to me earlier this year. i never got a chance to try it on in stores  but when i saw it online and on sale i snagged it. what i didn't realize was the intricate design of this blouse. ithas really pretty lace all over the top and then fine beading securely sewn on. the blouse has crochet sleeve designs and also a very pretty neck bib area. it fits me tts and very comfortably. i love the airy feeling of it and it actually also isn't too long on,Blouses
1,I received many compliments on this top. it's very cute and versatile. a pair of jeans or a skirt or capris all can work well with this.,Blouses
1,I love this blouse. it's really pretty and very flattering. it makes your waist look small. i usually wear a size 6 or 8. after reading the reviews saying it ran small  i ordered an 8 and a 10. the 10 fit perfectly  so i didn't even try the 8 on. it is a little difficult to get on and off due to the zipper on the side. that is my only complaint.,Blouses
1,I love this blouse!! the shape is very flattering. the fabric is sheer  perfect for those hot summer days. i especially like the way the sleeves fall  just enough flounce. the buttons are a great detail. i didn't bother undoing them  just threw it over my head. looks great dressed up or down.,Blouses
1,"I bought this top in a size 6 - i'm 5'5"" with a longer torso. i thought at first that this would be too boxy and cropped but it fits very well and it still covers my stomach when i raise my arms up. the material is on the thicker side so it's a little more structured which i think gives it a nice look and drape. i feel like i could wear this shirt out on a casual day or to work with a blazer over it to dress it up more. i highly recommend it especially since the material is linen and cotton whic",Blouses
-1,I was attracted to the feminine design of the dress  the silhouette  the flouncy skirt; however  i ordered the red motif pattern and hated the splotchy  dark colors.,Dresses
-1,I am 5'2 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress  but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially. another reviewer said this was more like a shift  and she was right. not worth the price on sale.,Dresses
-1,I normally wear a medium in retailer dresses  but ordered a small due to the reviews that stated how large this dress is. they weren't exaggerating!!!! the small was way too big for me  and the xxs and xs are already sold out. beware that you will have to size down at least 2 sizes to make the dress fit similar to the model pictured. it is going back for me!,Dresses
-1,Thought this would be great for a laid-back wedding in new mexico  but didn't fit. i am a 12-14 and the 14 barely fit my chest and arms. not flattering. material did not seem very breakthable. had to return. better luck next time.,Dresses
-1,"When i ordered this dress  i thought to myself ""hmm  it seems a little close to showing some side boob  but maybe that's just the angle of the photo."" flash forward to me trying it on in my home - ""yep  that's some side boob."" it is very low cut under the arms. if you're super slim  this might be a good look  but on a curvy gal with some boobs  it was obscene. also  i'm a solid 12 in most retailer brands  so i ordered a l and an xl just in case. the xl wouldn't even zip up. returning.",Dresses
-1,I loved the idea of this dress and was hoping it would be worth the astronomical price tag for what really is a cotton jersey dress. unfortunately  this dress missed the mark. in the pictures this dress looks like the fabrics are navy blue and some sort of white. well  it is not white or whitish at all but baby pink! bright baby pink! even the light pattern on the navy background is actually pink. huge disappointment. my other issue is with the length of this dress. the description says that the,Dresses
-1,"I ordered this in the ""plum"" color  which in real life just looks like a very  very dark brown. that would probably be okay  but the dress is actually about 3 inches shorter than the listed measurements. i ordered the regular length  but the shortest part of the hem hits me only about halfway down my thigh...way  way too short. i am 5'5""  for reference. lastly  i think the fabric is just awful quality  especially for this price point. the slight texture makes it want to cling to itself - worn ou",Dresses
-1,I was looking for a dress for playing cello at my friend's wedding. the colors looked perfect  the cut was great  etc. very disappointed to find out how sparkly and scratchy the dress was in person  and sad that the slit came right to my knee  which is a really weird height. sadly returning - might purchase again if it goes on sale and i can't find anything better before the wedding :(,Dresses
-1,I really wanted to like this... it's soft and cozy and a nice shade of blue  but that's where the positives end. i ordered the xs and it was huge. wide  shapeless  and way too long (i'm 105lbs and 5'1). even if it came in petite  i'm not sure it's worth the price  because i can imagine the thin material losing its shape and getting stretched out.,Dresses
0,Unfortunately this dress ran very large on me (please no more vanity sizing!) and minimized what few curves i have. my store didn't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist. it also flares out quite a bit  you can see this in the catalog shot. while this wasn't flattering on me  it may work better on curvier figures.,Dresses
0,I just got this dress in the mail and tried it on. i loved it the fit was perfect tts  and it is very soft and comfortable. however  it appears that the black striped area has bled onto the off white portion and there are stripes of gray across the chest and blotches on the sides of the dress. i am sending it back and ordering another and hoping for the best. i am very concerned that when it is cleaned it will bleed again. i love the dress so much i am willing to risk it  but i am doubtful. so b,Dresses
0,This sweater dress color is great and texture is nice however ran huge. read the other reviews before ordering and ordered down to a medium and was just to boxy and could not get it to hang well. unfortunately it went back.,Dresses
0,This is a shift dress  which is a great dress for many people  in a kind of man-repeller way. by saying that  i mean  a really pretty dress that can show off amazing shoes  good legs  a beautiful face and hair. this is not a body con dress. however  when you do such a high neckline and boxy sleeves  you do no one any favors. everyone has a nice neck and decolletage and collarbone. everyone. the neckline needs to open up a bit....i'm not saying v-neck  just a bit lower than this  because it makes,Dresses
0,This dress is most definitely not a maxi! barely goes below the knees. also you do not get the cute detail shown on bodice. there are no folds which were an added plus on picture. waist is higher  not at natural waist. very pretty silk though and still cute. just not as pictured.,Dresses
0,Loved the style and color/design but this dress was simply too short in the front. the slip was also slightly tight over hips. i wish this was longer!,Dresses
0,"The minute i put this on i knew it was wrong. firstly  the neck was quite tight and i had to untie the side tie. secondly  as i stood looking in the mirror  the dress simply read ""nightgown"". it was frumpy and too long on me. so back it went.",Dresses
0,I wish his dress would have worked. it is beautiful!! however  the waist and bust runs very small. the bottom of the dress does flare out a bit but the waist is so tight that unless you are a stick  everything at your waist and hips will stick out.,Dresses
0,This truly is a dress and not a tunic. i normally wear a medium but they were sold out so i thought i would try a l petite. i am only 5'4 and the large p was really long. i could definitely wear as a dress with tights. i am hoping it comes back in stock so i can try a medium p. unfortunately it is going back. cute sweater as pictured on the model!,Dresses
1,I like this dress a lot. it does not have much form but with a belt looks great!,Dresses
1,"As others stated  it was a tad bizarre to have a mock neck on the spring dress  however  i would wear this in the fall with boots and a nice moto jacket. another ""but"" is i wasn't sure about the color. i am very pale and the pale color is pretty much my skin color... however  the blue flowers and black lace make up for it as far as colors  and everyone liked it on me. lastly  cut: wow  this was just really nice on  very flattering . i usually try on regular size in store and order petite  but th",Dresses
1,I like this dress. the floral pattern and little red beads. others may think it is baggy  however  i like this type of the style.,Dresses
1,First off  i love the dress! i love anything that you can throw on for a monday and be ready in 20 minutes. the material is good but the compartments for the bust do not hold a d+cup. i ordered the 6 and it fit perfectly except in the bust. easy fix  a white cami  the sale price makes that necessity acceptable. it's a keeper.,Dresses
1,Looks great on. fits beautifully ,Dresses
1,This dress is absolutely stunning!!! i'm 5 feet & curvy. it's flowy  lightweight & has some sparkle mixed in with the gorgeous print. it fit everywhere except when i got the zipper up to my chest. i'm a 36dd & it wasn't going to finish zipping. i was very sad! i even tried the biggest size they had - a 12 & it didn't work. if that zipper had been able to go all the way up & would own this dress.,Dresses
1,The dress is a great buy especially since it was on sale. it fits like his other dresses flattering as i don't have a big bust and have a bit of extra skin from pregnancies but with this dress i feel amazing. get a ton of compliments when i wear it!,Dresses
1,How could this not be flattering to every figure? bunching of fabric is awesome at hiding imperfections (i know  i have become a master at hiding some of my residual baby weight for years now). this  paired with a darker color (and not black  yay!) makes for a perfect combination in a dress. i love that this is a deep purple  it is a dark color which is slimming  but in addition it has more appeal being colored. and it is so versatile! wear it along or with a cardigan/jacket on top. heels or boo,Dresses
1,This dress is great  and looks even prettier in person  the colors are more vibrant. the ruching is very forgiving for the belly and the length is perfect. most maxi's are too long on me  but i ordered a ps and it fit perfect. my only complaint is that it is very low cut  which i was unaware of standing up  but when i sat down at a dinner party  well  let's just say i gave everyone a show :(. recommend wearing a cami or something underneath.,Dresses
-1,Bummer  i loved the lacy bell arms and everything about the look of this sweater but it is huge in the abdomen. seriously looks maternity to me. the neck is also too wide. the quality of the material is very nice and the weight is nice and heavy but the cut just didn't work on me. i returned this one.,Fine gauge
-1,It hangs very nicely on the model in the picture but when i put it on it fit tight in the sleeves and upper back but huge in the front. the sweater was also sparkly which made it look cheap. i loved the lace detail in the back but the sweater was returned. did not fit well and was not good quality. very thin,Fine gauge
-1,I got this top to wear with shorts as the color goes with a lot of different prints. the quality is excellent. this top runs very large  as in three (3) sizes too large. for the record i am a 34.25.35 and ordered my regular size the xs and this top makes me like i'm pregnant with twins. also  the layering looks nothing like it does on the model  it looks sloppy  unkept and a general. i think this would still be great for ladies who are bigger in the chest and waist  otherwise it just doesn't wor,Fine gauge
-1,The fit was not flattering at all  but the worst part was the colors were really dull and not bright as shown in the online photos.,Fine gauge
-1,I wanted to love this sweater and it has some nice distinctive features that make it more interesting than your average cardigan. unfortunately  however  i found that flared in an unflattering manner over my stomach. the chest fit well - though it was very low cut - but then if i buttoned the sweater it made me look like at least three sizes larger.  the quality seemed okay  but a bit thin and i was afraid that this would not hold up for long.,Fine gauge
-1,I agree with the other reviewer about the great colors  but when i took this off the rack to try one  you can see through both layers of fabric. i thought  insulting quality  for the price. i imagine the holes would start after one wearing.,Fine gauge
-1,This sweater is very long  could be worn as a dress at 5'3 !,Fine gauge
-1,This is not even a dolman style sweater because it's loose fitting everywhere around the arm. the point of a dolman sweater is that the sleeves are fitted around the wrist/forearm  but this is not the case with this sweater. it's super loose around the wrist area - i can fit both of my wrists into a sleeve.,Fine gauge
-1,This sweater was not as featured in the picture. the front is completely cropped while the back is regular length. the front barely reached the middle of my stomach. also  the color was not as vibrant as shown in the picture. this sweater will be going back.,Fine gauge
0,I ordered this sweater in black and thought it was a pretty design and something different in a cardigan. when i tried it on  it was an odd fit and very boxy and unflattering. i wanted to like it and keep it  but i knew i would not wear it so  unfortunately  it went back.,Fine gauge
0,Let me start by saying that i cannot wear wool. it doesn't matter what type it is or if it is combined with cashmere  it makes me itch so much that i just can't do it and i didn't not find this as itchy as others stated. that being said  you definitely need to size down. i am a standard small and purchased the xs and there is still a load of fabric. i still don't know what to think. i think it is okay but i am not sure it justifies the price point.,Fine gauge
0,Cute details but not happy with the fit. runs wide and short. the peplum fabric on bottom is stiff  wrinkles easily  and lays funny. returning this one.,Fine gauge
0,Loved this top  but had to return it. the collar is gorgeous but terrible quality,Fine gauge
0,Sooooo soft! not a ton of shape but very versitile and warm!,Fine gauge
0,I typically wear a size xl in retailer clothes. i'm a size 16 in tops and this sweater in xl fit really baggy with no form fitting. it's super soft and i love the color  but it was just unflattering on me.,Fine gauge
0,This is a thick sweater. it is pretty  but has a short length.,Fine gauge
0,"Just got this in the mail yesterday and i want so badly to love it but it's just a little too big and boxy. i'm 5'5""  125lbs and ordered a small but i really wish i'd ordered the xs. not sure if i'll exchange or just return. seems high quality and the pattern is gorgeous. it's basically exactly what i'm looking for until i actually put it on and then it just kind of looks like i'm wearing my grandpa's old sweater.",Fine gauge
0,This shirt is beautiful  however i thought that it was made of a softer  lighter material. it is  instead  made of a thick  heavy material that was unflattering for my shape. ( short torso ann's large bust) it made me look boxy and chunky in the middle. sadly  i'll be returning it.,Fine gauge
1,Very soft  comfy  lightweight sweater. perfect for layering as the weather gets cooler. looks great with jeans or jean shorts.,Fine gauge
1,I like the detail in this cardigan. the shape is true to the fit on the model of the main picture  the sleeves are a bit long  however i am 5'2.5 and 107 lbs  i ordered and kept the xxsp. great staple item!,Fine gauge
1,I got this in the wine  which is a beautiful color. the design is nice and looks expensive (but i'm not sure how it will hold up)  the fabric is very nice  medium weight and drapes well. it is a little boxy but would be nice to layer over a button down.,Fine gauge
1,Order a size down. i ordered a small from catalog and returned it to the store for an xs.  run large in the chest and down. the fit is more flowing than form fitting. nice material  not itchy at all.,Fine gauge
1,Love  love  love. i have both colors and wear with leggings. it's not a heavy sweater and has a great drape  super flattering. i'm usually a medium and it runs true to size - not supposed to be tight. i find it a little low in the front but a tank underneath takes of it. washes well.,Fine gauge
1,I really like this sweater. i would suggest ordering a size up. i could had worn my normal size but a size up was much more comfortable. i have a burnt orange skirt that i wear with this and it makes the flowers pop.,Fine gauge
1,"This sweater is really cute  and comfortable - but the color is a tad off from the picture. it's a deeper blue than i was expecting  and the pocket is not a ""rust"" color as depicted online. it's definitely closer to red. other than that  i still do like it - the speckles are a nice touch  and it is true to size  and not too short.",Fine gauge
1,"Just tried 'layered sadie top' and it felt so nice on. good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed. this item is definitely ""vanity-sized"". i'm 5'1  113lbs and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model. it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternity-esque. highly recommend because it's gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you",Fine gauge
1,Yes  it is big. but it is also amazing. so soft  the colors are great  and the hood  well  the hood makes it. great colors for fall. it's a poncho. it's not supposed to be fitted. i'll be wearing this all fall through winter. love it.,Fine gauge
-1,"Loved how this draped and im super petite 5'1""(32b bust) and this was seriously one of the most ill fitting items i have every owned. i purchased the pxs and it was huge. i hope this has a better fit as the other reviewers seem to have a more positive review. i was just appalled as to how bad the measurements were off. unfortunately the straps are not adjustable so this went below my chest. too sad retailer  please get the fit right!!",Intimates
-1,Material is strange. triangle top is funky. this is just not awesome in any way.,Intimates
-1,You have to be a contortionist to get this bra on. it slips over your head and i needed my 8yo daughter to help me pull it down past my elbows. ridiculously impractical. why oh why didn't heather give it a hook and loop closure instead?,Intimates
-1,"This nightgown looked so comfy and cute! i ordered a large and it was so uncomfortably tight.i'm 5'3"" and 150lbs. it was such a shame. size large should not just be really a medium!",Intimates
-1,Fun  sexy underwear but rides up in the front. will return,Intimates
-1,This bra runs very small  and is hard to get on and off. i think if i went a size up i would be happier.,Intimates
-1,It seemed to stay in place and did not require constant readjustment. however  i found the band to be extremely small and tight. it is not the most comfortable bra because of the way the band just presses into your skin.,Intimates
-1,This could have been an amazing chemise but it is too short even for bed- perhaps it could be used for a tank. i am 5'3 but do have a long torso. it did not fully cover my booty.,Intimates
-1,"Got this in the sky color. returned it because the top is way too sheer for me  if you know what i mean. i wanted a pretty gown i can wear without a robe in front of my kids. no can do. also  for the price  material just felt flimsy & cheap. it does run small ~ the medium was good on me and i'm 5'2""  114#  34b",Intimates
0,This is pretty and provides coverage with a bit of support for wearing around the house. i'm a 34b so i ordered the small- it still had room in it so i tightened the straps and used the tightest hooks on the back  and that makes it fit ok. i bought it just to wear at home since i was not expecting a great deal of support or shaping  and while it feels ok it is not super-comfy- it's a bit scratchy around the edges. i was going to buy another color if i loved this  but as it is i will keep the one,Intimates
0,I wanted to love this set  but sadly it just didn't fit as i had hoped. the small was bigger than expected and looked frumpy and not sexy. returned.,Intimates
0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates
0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,Intimates
0,As a petite  big busted woman  i found this dress wildly unflattering. the quality and pattern of the dress itself is beautiful  though it will require a slip as it is completely transparent. the design of the bust however  i found unflattering.,Intimates
0,I ordered this in black and white  thinking you can never have enough silk camisoles.     i returned the black because it looked like polyester. the white is actually a cream/ivory  not bright white as pictured. it is also not the best feeling quality  however the fit is good  and true to size.,Intimates
0,I really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i couldn't even get both arms in. i got a size small and probably needed a large; but as far as the quality and color  it's really pretty! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out.,Intimates
0,I'm a 32-a  and i bought a small. i found that the tube portion is pretty tight  but probably needed to keep things up. because there is not a clasp in the front or back  it is really hard to get in and out of. i'd probably be ok with it  but the cups were too big for me. i think i would need to be a c to fill it.  the quality is really nice and the molded cups are a good shape. i wish i could have made it work  because it was really comfortable. i returned it in the end.,Intimates
0,"The fit is gorgeous  but i didn't realize it was completely transparent. when it says ""mesh"" it means ""mesh""! i was thinking the ""mesh"" part was on the bottom. because of how it is cut  high on the shoulders  you can't wear a cami underneath to provide coverage. very cute  but not practical.",Intimates
1,This bra is so well made and fits beautifully.,Intimates
1,Makes me feel like a sexy ice skater. true to size  i am 5'0 and 120 lb and both the small and medium fit. i kept the medium. love it!,Intimates
1,Well-made  gorgeous bra! the 'red' is more wine in person  which is great. this bra runs quite small--go up at least 1 band and 1 cup size. i got a 36c and it fits great! (i'm a 34b across brands like vs  etc.)   you'll feel extra saucy and a bit mischievous knowing you're wearing something this sexy.,Intimates
1,This bra is so soft and comfortable i feel like i'm not wearing a bra at all  except i have the gentle support i need. the material is very thin and the pink color is see through  so not recommended under a white or see through shirt. perfect for sleeping or lounging in!,Intimates
1,I love this gown so much  i would wear it everyday if i could. it is cozy  beautiful  and feels special like an heirloom. the top is perfect coverage and the skirt is so soft. color is much prettier than the photo picks up!!! i love this gown. my favorite  hands down.,Intimates
1,I ordered this in sand and loved it so much when i received it that i went back and ordered it in black as well. it is very flattering and sexy!,Intimates
1,A great long line bra! beautiful and well made however it's tough to get the fit perfectly right. i usually wear a 32 b or 34 a and am 115lbs. the small was the best fit as the 32 (xs) was a very small 32. i could almost say it more of a 30 if that's even a size. it also rubs my skin few places so definitely not meant to be worn for more than a few hours. otherwise i recommend it!,Intimates
1,Well fitting bra  comfortable (not itchy)  lace doesn't show through tops.,Intimates
1,This was a gift for a bachelorette. very pretty and sexy without being too over the top. love the print!,Intimates
-1,I wanted this jacket to fit on me like in the photo  but i guess my frame was still to petite. the fabric was also on the cheap end,Jackets
-1,I wore this blazer for one day  didn't do anything strenuous  and the fabric started to disintegrate along the back  next to the center seam. it's completely unfixable  since it's not the seam that split but the fabric itself. what a waste of money.    as to the fit  it is a boxy cut through the waist. it looks better unbuttoned than buttoned. the jacket also shows a lot of the shirt you have under it  so it's good over something cute.    or  it would be  if it didn't fall apart.,Jackets
-1,"I might be the only odd person out there who think this jacket is not perfect at all. a lot of other reviewers said that the jacket runs small. for me  it's not true at all  i had to go to xxp petite to find the fit acceptable  but it was simply too short (rather than 20"" as it states on the website  it's more like 18"")  which is a thing i almost never experienced because i am a petite person! i don't even want to go regular size because it would've been too big. i saw some photos that others po",Jackets
-1,I really loved this vest online and decided to try it on in store. it was really cute on and fit nicely so i purchased it (in my normal size) and took it on a vacation. first time wearing it and the color transferred all over my white shirt even though it says it is pre-washed. i am very disappointed considering how expensive this was. overall  it is very cute but it may ruin your clothes so beware!,Jackets
-1,This jacket was cute  however  i am normally a large with a bit of room to spare.  this has the irritating issue of not fitting under the arms and across the chest and shoulders.  it is not my shape as most other brands at retailer fit me. this jacket is not sized correctly.,Jackets
-1,Does not look like the picture. lined with a cheap denim fabric inside that shows when arms are rolled up. i normally always fit in mediums and this jacket is so small in the arms as well as body that it fit like a xs.,Jackets
-1,I bought this online in the grey and blue and had high hopes. it runs big so size down at least 1-2 sizes. i didn't realize that the sweater looking part on the forearms was part of the coat. that part of the coat is really nice and comfy. unfortunately  the rest of the coat (the wool part) is very itchy. it would've been awesome if it was lined on the inside  but it's not...so i'm taking them back.,Jackets
-1,After reading the previous reviews i thought sizing down would be a great idea. as soon as i pulled it out of the bag i knew that the xs/s was still wayyy too big. for reference i am 5'3 and a 34ddd and usually wear an 8 but this thing was enormous. it was shapeless and boxy but done so horribly it looked like i was pregnant. it has an adjustable draw string at the bottom which helps to make you look like a balloon. such a disappointment. the design was lovely and it looked very high quality and,Jackets

0,The material is so soft and cozy. there is just enough padding to keep me warm all year round in southern california. but  i ended up leaving the store without this vest  bc 1)the cut is slightly boxy.  2) every vest had different color variations. you definitely should go into the store to check it out. the ones i saw made the vest have cheap pattern of wide stripes  not an even vintage fade as shown. i'm so sad as everything else is perfect. fits true to size,Jackets
0,You guys  i love this so much! however  within one hour of wearing it  the back seam completely ripped. it fit me perfectly... sadly i&#39;ll have to return the damaged item. really sad it&#39;s all sold out too!,Jackets
0,Ordered this vest in both the xs and pxs. i liked the length and overall fit of the xs  however  i ended up returning both due to how the vest draped. the outer fabric is a bit more stiff which made the vest balloon out more then what i liked. overall  it?s not a terrible vest but just not for me.,Jackets
0,Very pretty but runs tight - i usually wear an 8 or small/med in retailer jackets and couldn't zip up the 8 (am a 36c and thick/broad at the top) as there is no give. this is also more like a fitted shirt  made of lightweight muslin-like fabric. was looking for a summer jacket to wear over knits in a chilly  air conditioned office setting so sadly it didn't work for me. could be cute on someone with a smaller frame over a tank or cami.,Jackets
0,The vest looks  so stylish on. it makes a regular t shirt look edgy with it on. i love the vest but the price is too high,Jackets
0,I saw this jacket and loved the plaid and the idea of a soft sherpa material as a lining was hard to pass up1it was true to size and the material was very nice. however  the button closure was difficult as the buttonholes seemed a bit too small. also  the back of the jacket did not lay flat and it kept rolling.... i had to return this jacket.,Jackets
0,I bought this (because it looks beautiful  is well made  and a high quality piece). when i got it home and tried it on  it did not achieve the look i was going for (boho). instead  it was very drapery and full and big and i felt like i was wearing a ghost costume on halloween. i do love retailer's kimonos and thought i'd love this one. but it's going back. i don't need any more clothes in my closet that i do not absolutely love and want to wear again and again. that is my new criteria for purchasi,Jackets
1,This jacket is exactly what i was looking for! it is a lightweight and comfortable material that will be perfect for fall/spring (and for layering during a mild winter!). i am 5'3  128 lbs  and generally wear a small - but i ordered a medium in this jacket and am happy i sized up. the jacket is roomy  but the cinched waist makes it flattering rather than shapeless. i'd definitely recommend this anorak to anyone!,Jackets
1,I have never loved denim jackets because they always have seemed kind of basic or boring. this one is edgy and the design is amazing. it can be worn with anything and will go through many seasons. i found the fit to be on point. my normal medium fit perfectly.,Jackets

1,I happened upon this in my local store despite the fact that it is an online exclusive. i love finding returns so i can see them in person. i loved the soft colors right away. my hesitation was the standup collar but it actually folds down just fine and gives the vest lapels too. it also looks nice belted  left slightly open. i usually wear small or xs in tops and the small fits nicely. it doesn't need to close since there are no built-in fasteners. i will wear it with a long button down shirt o,Jackets
1,"First of all  this doesn't come with a belt of any kind. that's a good thing  too. i am surprised that the stylist put one around this kimono. it looks odd  and  frankly  takes away from the shape of the piece. having said this  though  it is a nice accessory for basic tanks  t-shirts  and other tops and dresses that need a little umph... the kimono is blue  mostly  but it really doesn't appear to be ""striped"". it is sort of a line of small dots. it is sheer  but the polyester fabric has some bo",Jackets
1,I'm glad i took a chance and ordered this jacket. i love military inspired jackets and this one is very cute.  it runs a little big  so i'm glad i ordered a size down. i like that it can be worn open or buttoned. it looks great with jeans and boots but i can wear it to work as well. it's definitely more on the casual side  but still a very versatile piece in my closet. love it.,Jackets

-1,I love the coh fleetwood jeans  and since i was looking for a pair of not-so-skinny skinny jeans  i thought these would be great. but unlike the fleetwoods  which are a substantial weight denim  these are very soft -- too soft -- and bag out in the first 5 minutes. the style is okay but the fabric makes them unflattering. maybe if you're looking for jeans you can lounge in  these will be for you because they do have the comfort equivalent of sweats.,Jeans
-1,Loved these when i tried them on they fit well and were so flattering. i am a size 0/2 and 5' tall and have a 'bubble butt' and thicker thighs with a narrow waist i tried on a 24 they we a little tight on my bum and thighs but the waist was perfect  tried on a 25 and they were much more comfortable on my legs and worked on my waist as well. i thought all was good but after wearing them out for not even ten minutes they started slipping down constantly and loosed up around all areas especially my,Jeans
-1,I've been buying stevie ankles for years from retailer and been very happy. the past two pairs i bought had a heavy chemical smell  which i imagine is some kind of starch/chemical to keep the denim stiff. with the first pair  after enough washes to get rid of the bad smell (4)  they lost all form and looked terrible since they were washed i couldn't return them. the 2nd pair arrived with the same heavy smell and i returned them. it may be they are made elsewhere now  but it's disappointing.,Jeans

-1,As a tall girl  i was thrilled to see that these pants come in longs! they are amazing for dressing up (or sassing up) and outfit. i anxiously anticipated their arrival and wore them the very first night i bought them. however  as someone previously mentioned the quality is poor. after wearing them to they symphony  the knee tore while i was sitting in my seat! i really don't see a way to avoid this from happening since i had not moved. i'm sooo upset because i absolutely loved these pants!,Jeans
-1,So after reading the 2 reviews  decided to just order my usual size (26)  thinking they might be a tad snug. wrong! they were huge! i looked at the size to see if they sent me a size 30 by mistake! unfortunately small sizes sold out. quality is excellent as well as style  so bummed!,Jeans
-1,While you can't count on the photo on your monitor to portray the exact color of an item  these photos are way off.  instead of the warm charcoal i see online  the pants are more of a dusty blue.  the material has very little stretch and i couldn't get into the size 24s.  the 25s were tight in the entire leg but huge in the waist.  for reference i usually wear a size 24 in brands like 7 for all mankind and citizens of humanity.,Jeans
-1,Where o where did the old pilcro ankle stet go??? these are a cheap impersonator. the denim used to be thick which really did wonders for the fit and overall appearance of how the denim lays over your lower half. the last 3 pairs of pilcro stets i've ordered have gone right back because they are nowhere close to the greatness they were originally. the pockets on these jeans sit so so low- completely unflattering. the ankles are significantly smaller circumferentially. the old stet ankle jeans ha,Jeans

0,Bought these for the color however these just did not work for me. the 26 was too small and the 27 was baggy. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a 26. beautiful color and good denim. if you are looking for a looser fit  more of a straight leg fit...this is a good jean with a fun pop of color.,Jeans
0,Those pants sit pretty snug on top and get very wide very fast. this looks odd in my opinion if you do not wear a tunic style top like on the picture. also the material is quite thin  which makes the snug part look unflattering. they were not for me unfortunately.,Jeans
0,I had high hopes for these as coh is my favorite brand of denim  and these crops were made specifically for petites. also  i was happy to see they were described as a straight jean  not a skinny. the fit and sizing seems to be a little off. i ordered my regular size in this brand  27p  but they were too big. sized down to a 26p. they were still too large in the waist (seemed very stretchy) but fit well in the legs. i like the fact that these crops were made for petites so the length was perfect ,Jeans

0,I always have to try on tops of retailer. i know this  and yet i ordered a top through the website anyway. i don't think i'll do it again. the drape of the top seen in the pictures did not translate in real life because the top scratched up pretty quickly. ironically  when i washed it (according to directions) it also shrunk quite a bit.,Knits

1,I love this top! it's perfect for casual outings like a picnic or a movie in summer. it's material is thick enough to feel sturdy but still is very lightweight for summer. it's a little baggy in the front so if that bothers you then i'd size down one size from your normal. i bought my usual size of xs and it seems to fit perfectly. i'm tempted to buy this in more colors.,Knits
1,Lovely sweater that is good with jeans or a skirt. i ordered an xl and my only complaint is that i wish it were a bit longer in the front. i am heavy chested though so that's how most tops fit me. i ordered the gray/black and it's really nice. i receive lots of compliments.,Knits

1,This is one of the best date night tops i've seen in a while. i'm 5'6  120 lbs and the xs is perfect. the fit is spot on and the fabric feels nice. i will need a teeny tiny safety pin to keep the front closed  but i do that often so i don't see it as a design flaw.,Knits
1,I purchased this in the green color  and in person it does have a little bit of blue in it so it's a very flattering color. the blouse has a simple shape but the details are what makes this an interesting piece. it looks as good under a suit as it does with jeans and a leather jacket. fits tts.,Knits
-1,This top is beautiful - even more so in person. however  like a previous reviewer  the fit is very boxy. there is so much excess fabric that poofs out on the sides that you can't see in the photos due to the model's cardigan and arms. if this top had been a bit longer and more fitted  without all the excess fabric at the bottom  it would have been perfect. again  the color  the lace  the fabric and the pleating is all gorgeous. would love it if the designer took this into consideration and came,Layering

1,I love camisoles like this  and retailer always has great ones! it has a nice length  so the lace detail can show underneath a jacket or shorter cardigan. it's fitted  but not tight.,Layering
1,This is a cute top. not perfectly made  a little boxy  but also not a crop top on me (5'5). it looks cute with high waisted jeans.,Layering
1,I was not expecting the material to be as thick as it is. it has a wonderful drape and hand to it. i love the string tie straps so i can adjust it to fall on my chest a little higher. it seems that everything is too low-cut for my modest taste  but the ties let you decide how much cleavage to show. finding the right bra is always a little bit of a challenge with a cami  but i usually wear them under sweaters and jackets  so i'm not terribly concerned.,Layering

-1,Tried this twice in yellow because for the price it seems like it would be such a useful piece  but the quality is below average for an retailer dress. it's just a shapeless  thin  beach cover-up that i could've picked up anywhere. the yellow color is so cute though. if you're looking for a light  breezy  go-to-the-beach dress that you can shove in a bag with your towel  this might be good for you  but it's too thin for just about anything else.,Lounge
-1,This is a very soft and comfortable jacket but it has holes in the pocket area. it was returned to the store and the other jackets had the same problem although not in the same area. the store was considering pulling the product off their shelves. it is unclear if the holes are just the beginning of a pocket or what. but it was flawed by everyone who looked at it.,Lounge

0,I really wanted this jumpsuit to be my holiday staple! i ordered this jumpsuit in a sz 4 (my typical size) - the jumpsuit doesn't have a waist  i suppose the ribbon created the illusion of a waist. most jumpsuits are super slimming because of having a waistband and this does not besides the bow. also what i found strange is the back zipper goes all the way down passed your bottom - it's the longest zipper i've ever seen. it's very body hugging so it shows your curves if you have any. i will sadl,Pants
0,I sized up based on other reviews which was good advice. i am typically a size 6 but sized up to a 10. the pants are very unique and i think on the right body type would look amazing. it seems like someone with curves and a small waist might fit these splendidly...but that's not me. i had some extra material puffing about in the zipper region. i also expected the material to be thicker but found it to be more silky.,Pants

1,I love these pants. the material is so nice and well made. i love the glittery threads within the pattern. the waistband is elastic which is good for me as my waistline fluctuates. these pants can be dressed up or down. the length was perfect and hit at my ankle (i'm 5'3). the only flaw is that i wish the pant leg was slimmer around the ankle. it would be a more flattering look. .     one thing to note: if you have a big butt or do not like to emphasize that part of you  these are not the pants,Pants

-1,I bought this in the blue and really wanted to like it--i had plans to check sizing and then order it again in the red  as well! however  this skirt falls victim to the recent design trend of using a pattern for a structured skirt but substituting a softer fabric and (horrors!) an elastic waistband. this ended up just looking kind of cheap and sweatshirty as a result. back it went.,Skirts
-1,"I absolutely loved the patterns and colors of this skirt  if only the cut wasn't so odd. the sides of the skirt ""wing out"" for a very distracting and unflattering look. the stiff  felt-like quality of the material only makes matters worse. in that respect  the model photos are not at all accurate. it also runs large. i had to go down one full size.",Skirts
-1,This skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo. i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big  but nothing that affected the look of the skirt. the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together  almost like sunday school felt cut outs (but stiffer) (not a fan).. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple  and the color washed me out. definitely not worth the price (for me anyways). good luck!,Skirts
-1,This was disappointing to me. i love how this looks on the model. unfortunately it made me look huge. it was all bunched up after i buttoned and put it on. i didn't find it was tts  i am a 10 m and got the m. it was too tight in the waist. before i'd even put it on  i noticed the waist looked very small. i don't even think the sizing issue caused the material bunching. it's like the buttons didn't match up or something.,Skirts
-1,This skirt is very pretty  but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized  so there's very little stretch. for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements  there's no way to get this skirt on past the hips.,Skirts

-1,This sweater looks great in the picture but when it came in the mail turned out to be enormous. i tried it with a belt on like in the picture but that just made the whole sweater bunch up everywhere. the quality is nice. maybe sizing down would help. but the medium/large is going back. i am normally a medium.,Sweaters
-1,This sweater was just okay. i am happy to pay $100 or more for a sweater but this one was somewhat itchy  and not the quality i expected for that price. i may have kept it if it were at about half the price  but it just was not worth it. retailer prices seem to be going up and up and the quality less and less. i had similar experiences with a couple of shirts that i ordered over the summer. looked great in the photos  but unfortunately in person were not quality garments.,Sweaters
